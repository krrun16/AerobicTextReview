AMPLIFYING VOLUME:



???  How will we ever distinguish between the instructor talking or breathing hard? 
	Seems like thats around the same level of the instruction.



Pseudocode:
Vocal isolation using spleeter => (Ex. !spleeter separate -o output/ Video.mp3)
Amplify Audio by 10dB with ffmpeg => (Ex. ffmpeg -i vocals.wav -filter:a "volume=10dB" vocals_vid_#_volume.wav
Sound Finder Threshold => Audio below -2dB as silence / minimum duration of .1 seconds (Find way in Python)

By eye accuracy, this method works very well for video 1 & 3. Music is too loud on Video 2, which honestly could
	be a contributing factor to confusion in instructing exercises. 


Is there a way we can distinguish the difference between the instructor level volume and the silence volume
to amplify audio only if volume above silence volume...?
