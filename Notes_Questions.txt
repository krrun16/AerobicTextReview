AMPLIFYING VOLUME:



???  How will we ever distinguish between the instructor talking or breathing hard? 
	Seems like thats around the same level of the instruction.



Pseudocode:
Vocal isolation using spleeter => (Ex. !spleeter separate -o output/ Video.mp3)
Amplify Audio by 10dB with ffmpeg => (Ex. ffmpeg -i vocals.wav -filter:a "volume=10dB" vocals_vid_#_volume.wav
Sound Finder Threshold => Audio below -2dB as silence / minimum duration of .1 seconds (Find way in Python)

By eye accuracy, this method works very well for video 1 & 3. Music is too loud on Video 2, which honestly could
	be a contributing factor to confusion in instructing exercises. 


Is there a way we can distinguish the difference between the instructor level volume and the silence volume
to amplify audio only if volume above silence volume...?

Once the two exercise video were recorded into Audacity, I used the built-in Sound Finder function in Audacity to create 
labels of when the host was instructing. Using a threshold of labeling any audio below 8 dB as silence and the minimum 
duration of that silence being 0.2 seconds, we were able to obtain labels of when the instructor was speaking with 
Cohen's Kappa of 98% and 88%.
