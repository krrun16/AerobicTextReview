Calvin's Work:

3 Beginner videos\Calvin_Videos
	Video_#: accompaniment.wav 	<Music from using spleeter>
		 vocals.wav 		<Vocals from using spleeter>
		 video_#.mp3 		<original recording in audacity>
		 EDITED_LEGIT_LABELS 	<labeled timestamp durations of sound detected in video>
	

3 Beginner videos\scripts
	amplify.py:			<Amplifies a WAV file by a given scaling factor (Command Line Accessible)>
			Github doc: https://github.com/russellcardullo/python-dsp/blob/master/amplify.py

	
	Graphing_Audio.py		<TO UPDATE>

	
	Labels.Percent.py: 		<Gives percent of instruction based of labels exported from audacity
							(Command Line Accessible)>
			I wrote this program.


	Percent_of_Instruction.py 	<Finds Percent of Instruction from a Wav import, dB threshold TBD (CMA)>
			I wrote this program


	silence_remove.py: 		<TO UPDATE>



	Labels.Percent.py: 		<Gives percent of instruction based of labels exported from audacity

	Video_#: 			<Link, Views, Date Posted, Video Length, Words Per Minute, and transcript>


3 Beginner Videos
	Percentage of Instruction: 	<Actual Percentage of Instruction, Runs through percent_of_instruct.py with
						different dB thresholds. 


LOOK AT TOMORROW:

graph dB differences with splitting with spleeter and also the difference with silence remove
Change mp3s to wavs



CONCERNS TO THINK ABOUT:

Detecting heavy breathing as instruction or not: can manually detect in audacity, but not sure what the python 
	script will do. 

-- I think when an instructor uses a mic it detects a lot of breathes as instruction
