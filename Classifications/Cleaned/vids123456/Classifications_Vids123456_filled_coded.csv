hey everybody it's your personal trainer coach Kozak here from HASFIT,15
getting a lot of work in in a short period of time,15
come back repeat it get better that's what it's all about,15
"working on the gun
show",15
"right, that defeats the purpose",15
but overall very comparable movements you decide which one is right for you ,15
if you don't feel comfortable the overhead quite yet grab a seat,15
ready to get this thing going,15
this routine is great for both men and women of a beginner fitness level,15
And I'm Claudia and this is our beginner weight training routine,15
so if you want to do the easier modified versions you go and follow Claudia,15
Claudia's got a gun show with her tank top on tonight,15
look at those guns anyway just admiring my wife's guns,15
I know your legs are probably starting to feel it I didn't forget about you,15
and if you're wondering why we didn't take a longer break even though we're beginners that's because the workout specifically designed to allow some muscles to rest while others are working,15
allows us to get a lot done in a short period of time,15
I always say in your front are the show muscles in the back are the go muscles,15
basically means all your power and real athleticism comes from your backside,15
I'll clean that name up later okay,15
and then you're like oh man my knees hurt,15
it's work putting in the work right here,15
remember I said while one body parts resting the others working,15
burn so good,15

"hey it looks like we have more than 1,500 people working out with us today",15
so this week we've been thinking about new perspectives and what I have had to really think about this time is changing things and looking at everything as an opportunity you know,15
I'm used to going to the gym and lifting heavy things but what I've  been loving is changing the tempos going faster on some reps maybe slowing down some things some of the movements that I'm so used to picking up heavy weight,15
I just use my body and challenge myself in such a different way,15
I look at it as a brand new opportunity so that's my new perspective for this week and for the past few months,15
Oh Jake you've earned those waffles after this workout are they gonna have chocolate chips in them or bananas,15
I prefer chocolate chip banana pancakes,15
that's actually what I made this morning for me and my partner,15
I haven't gotten to eat them yet though so I've got to warm them up again,15
don't forget we have more of these workouts available on the NTC app and NTC premium is free in the US right now,15

I've been loving everyone tuning in to all the workouts,15
Anthony I hope you're still with me well dancing to the music I know you can,15
so super Sam always killing it love you girl,15
I am loving this I am nice and sweaty I don't know about you guys but I am sweaty whoo,15
that's why I love doing single sided movements,15
because it always helps you recognize where your weaknesses are but not only that you're strengthening them,15
like for me I hurt my right ankle a long time ago and this sides a little wobbly for me,15
where you at mom are you still working out with me come on,15
you're why I work hard you taught me everything,15
so you gotta keep going mom ,15
Shala I'm so glad you're working with me thank you so much for being here it's been so fun,15
I love strength training it's something that's changed my life in so many different ways,15
when I was able to see how much stronger my body could be it was such a good reminder anytime anything was challenging for myself I could remember how I was able to take control and to make myself better and make myself stronger,15
so that's why I love the strength train,15
almost fell over good thing I got my fireplace,15
I see my Chicago families in the chat I love you guys I miss you all so much,15
I know I'm here in LA but Chicago will forever be my heart so I love you guys okay,15
see time flies by when you are having fun,15
so if you have any questions for me we're gonna answer them at the end of the chat cooldown,15
I can't even talk,15
now if you want to waddle over to your computer and ask you a question type it up,15
I'll answer when it is time for the cool down,15
okay they're keeping you up keeping you strong,15
I love it so many different cities joining in a chat right now from all over the US and I know my toronto fam is here too,15
I say a little you know they might over involve something that's called a burpee and everyone was like no,15
you can give me some some good old Kirstie Gotso hot sauce burpees whatever you want,15
and I know it's so super Sam is in the chat working out with us and girl is gonna crush these burpees right now aren't you girl,15
I don't even know what day it is anymore you ready for those burpees,15
let the calm happy thoughts swell through your body because this is it,15
let's just take a little nap alright just kidding,15
oh Anthony has been feeling this playlist his question is how can you get this playlist,15
you can check out the Spotify link in the YouTube description,15
told you my girl kills it Filipinos,15
Julio wants to know what shoes I'm wearing he wants a pair,15
these are the super rep this is a great shoe for hiit,15
so today it was a perfect workout it even has this thing called the Burpee break that puts you in a really great position for the burpees that we were in,15
Michelle asked so she's been doing it beginner workouts in the app and wondering what other workouts she could do to get stronger,15
well if you haven't already done my kick it off program which is a really great total body beginner strength program,15
Kirstey just released an awesome strengthen hit program that just came out,15
so there are tons of programs in there there's also a bunch of regular workouts that aren't in programs as well,15
so check them out alright,15
oh I love this question what does it mean to you to represent as an asian-american woman and athlete,15
I love this so much it's funny because this year was something was a year that I was like you know I really want to embrace being Who I am and where I came from,15
and I was actually born in the Philippines and I came to the US when I was only 2 years old,15
so obviously didn't remember the Philippines very much,15
I went for Christmas with my mom this past year for the first time and it was just so amazing to be able to get cultural touch with my culture,15
it's just really representing and being proud of everything that I do,15
and always remembering where it came from because you know my mom is such a big representation of all of my hard work and she's taught me everything,15
I really think it's because we came from the Philippines and I just like to be really proud of everything and I love Filipino food,15
and yeah I don't know if that really answers the question but yeah but anyway thank you everyone ,15
today's workout is a hundred percent low-impact,15
we have got some tough stuff coming today,15
it's ideal for new exercisers and people returning to exercise,15
and it features real body project members,15
welcome to a real start plus,15
this is the big one,15
the real start plus workout today,15
and we have Wade and Angie Mullins with us and they're here to show you how it's done,15
can't tell you how excited we are to have these guys all the way over from Vermont USA,15
the real Start Plus plan takes us further than the real start plan,15
Angie and Wade have both lost 60 pounds using body project workouts,15
and they're here to show us how it's done,15
real people real workouts real results,15
today we're just gonna enjoy ourselves,15
pause buttons there pause buttons your friend whenever you need to use it,15
that's a challenge but you guys have got to pick your place in there,15
doesn't mean you have to do the whole thing,15
I just want you to finish with us,15
enjoy moving your body today,15
enjoy being with us,15
and I hope you feel the same,15
feeling ready for this,15
you're feeling warm already,15
enjoying that march,15
I'll be honest I don't envy her one little bit,15
it's tough enough,15
all our impact everything we do here we will start is one low-impact and two standing,15
so you could be confident that you can be involved and work out the whole way through,15
that's different than saying you have to do every single moment,15
but you can be doing it with us,15
feeling this now already,15
I'm loving this,15
feel the energy from these guys,15
it is called real Star Plus,15
in case you're already a little bit upset with us for the speed and the intensity,15
but this is about taking your body on that bit further feel good,15
wherever you are if you need to break halfway through it's about progress not perfection,15
the physical body can do so much,15
that's what gets you through the moments,15
I can feel it Angie and them weights all right,15
I so don't envy you,15
I practiced this workout the other day,15
I got about 20 seconds in with weights and I thought I'll give them to Angie,15
I don't think I can do that,15
not ready for that,15
it's tough enough as it is,15
as always at body project you can punch anyone you like,15
except Angie me or Wade that's off-limits as much as you might want to,15
feeling good we've got this we've got this,15
I might have lost everybody there but it's important to show you some different variations,15
that's the good news,15
feel the burn,15
believe you can because you can and you will,15
this workout it's like an Everest,15
its here to find the place that you can,15
get to working through,15
good work there Wade loving that bud,15
how are you doing Angie good Angie,15
I've been wanting to do that for years ANGIE right,15
I don't think Angie likes me as much as she did before,15
working hard suck up the adrenaline,15
the clock keeps ticking,15
doesn't mean you have to,15
I hope you're enjoying today's workout,15
if you'd like to take part in the rest of the real Start Plus plan with myself Angie and Wade come and join us at teen body project.com,15
I don't really think it's fair to have the word just anywhere near this workout to be honest,15
but it's there it's there,15
loving the energy guys,15
both of them are good,15
we're winners we're winning this is the halfway mark,15

I have designed this workout for you guys to enjoy moving,15
I feel like a bit of a fibber,15
this second half we're gonna put in even more than the first half,15
we're gonna really show how we can do it,15
how we can roll our best effort,15
your personal best effort not my best not Wade's best not Angie's best,15
if you need to pull up to come back,15
it's all winning every single moment that passes,15
this is the real start,15
if I were where you are right now and I didn't have these guys watching I'd be taking an extra cheeky break but I'm gonna go ,15
we know these hurt your mind,15
"you know what I call it, I call that change juice",15
it hurts yes it burns yes,15
but there it is flowing through your body and changing your body,15
that's what matters that's what counts,15
taking it up a level with a real start plus today,15
make no mistake about that this is different gravy,15
this is another gear yet,15
I want to see come on Wade,15
show me that game face,15
I am so dripping,15
feel like I'm standing under Niagara Falls,15
they're gonna feel the waterfalls of progress washing over us haha,15
there's not much in the tank now,15
who said you need high impact to get a fantastic heart raising super tough body changing life transforming workout,15
the active recoveries are making this level 4 work out,15
the official rating is 3 I'm going to tell you now that's the trick into you pressing play,15
I'll be honest I kind of make up a little bit of a lie to getting you in,15
this is no longer physical ,15
understand that your body wants to give up it wants to stop,15
I'm not so sure right now,15
and I almost lost my bearings,15
because I want to keep the energy high,15
Angie's going high impact me and Wade we're going low,15
she's putting some punches in I love that spirit look at that,15
like thoroughbred horses we are running to it,15
that's how we feel that's who we are,15
Angie look at the speed,15
come here first-ever buddies project work out,15
how well did these guys do,15
it is like we've all been in the shower right,15
that is what I call a kick off workout,15
I just figured if you're gonna be here of filming we might as well go in at the deep end right,15
we might as well just go in and get it done,15
how good does it feel now,15
how good do you feel having done that session today,15
we'll just let that heart rate come down,15
it takes a little while,15
that's how it's feeling,15
low-impact I'll say again all standing,15
that was a body changing change juice filled workout,15
and as long as you're here stretching with us,15
if you marched through the whole session that's great,15
whether you did half of each section,15
whether you press pause 20 times,15
or 10 percent of each section it,15
doesn't matter because you can come back tomorrow and do a little bit more,15
never question yourself,15
every moment that you move your body is a step towards the outcome that you want,15
it's not gonna be dramatic,15
change comes because of consistent decisions and the day is a workout but done,15
however you did with it it is done,15
it is the win and nobody can take that away from you,15
now it's a win we've won,15
unless you're doing another workout and in that case I probably question your sanity,15
but that's up to you,15
lifting up above I am certainly done for the day,15
that's 100% and let's enjoy a nice hang here,15
over as we say luxuriating enjoying and relishing of victory and our own brilliance,15
what a great session,15
