hey everybody it's your personal trainer coach Kozak here from HASFIT.
getting a lot of work in in a short period of time
come back repeat it get better that's what it's all about
"working on the gun
show"
"right, that defeats
the purpose"
but overall very comparable movements you decide which one is right for you if you don't feel comfortable the overhead quite yet grab a seat
ready to get this thing going
"this routine is great
for both men and women of a beginner  fitness level"
And I'm Claudia and this is our beginner weight training routine
"so if you want to do
the easier modified versions you go and
follow Claudia"
"Claudia's got a gun show with her tank top on tonight look at those guns anyway
just admiring my wife's guns"
"I know your legs are probably starting to feel it I didn't forget
about you"
coming back repeating it
and if you're wondering why we didn't take a longer break even though we're beginners that's because the workout specifically designed to allow some muscles to rest while others are working
"so right now
our backs working but at the same time
our chest may be resting"
allows us to get a lot done in a short period of time
I always say in your front are the show muscles in the back are the go muscles
basically means all your power and real athleticism comes from your backside
I'll clean that name up later okay
and then you're like oh man my knees hurt
"it's work putting in the
work right here"
thank you so much for your hard work today
remember I said while  one body parts resting the others working
burn so good

"I know she's had her wake and drink
coffee already this morning"
"come on squad we're doing this together
whatever level you're at you and me together let's go"
"ground oh and I guess

Chrissy how you feelin how about you Tracy I love when my fellow Nike master trainers hang out with me on the work outs

"hey it looks like
we have more than 1,500 people working
out with us today"
so this week we've been thinking about new perspectives and what I have had to really think about this time is changing things and looking at everything as an opportunity you know
"I'm used to going to the gym and lifting heavy things but what I've  been loving is changing the tempos going faster on some reps maybe slowing down some things
some of the movements that I'm so used to picking up heavy weight"
I just use my body and challenge myself in such a different way
"I look at it as a brand new opportunity so that's my new
perspective for this week and for the
past few months"
Oh Jake you've earned those waffles after this workout are they gonna have chocolate chips in them or bananas
"I prefer chocolate chip banana
pancakes"
that's actually what I made this morning for me and my partner
I haven't gotten to eat them yet though so I've got to warm them up again
"don't forget we have more of these
workouts available on the NTC app and NTC premium is free in the US right now"
It has amazing programs in there so don't forget to check it out
heart rate is probably still a little high
shout out to my running mommies who have been tuning in finish my program recently now you're doing Kirstie's I love it
"got a shout out to
the most amazing women that I know in LA"
you ladies are so inspiring thank you for pushing everyone around you
it's been really fun to watch all of you guys tuning in the past few weeks / months
"at this point it's been really inspiring you guys are keeping me
motivated so thank you for that"
I've been loving everyone tuning in to all the workouts
Anthony I hope you're still with me well dancing to the music I know you can you can get the little dance breaks in between
so super Sam always killing it love you girl
I am loving this I am nice and sweaty I don't know about you guys but I am sweaty whoo
that's why I love doing single sided movements
because it always helps you recognize where your weaknesses are but not only that you're strengthening them
like for me I hurt my right ankle a long time ago and this sides a little wobbly for me
so heart rates probably up on this one
where you at mom are you still working out with me come on
you're why I work hard you taught me everything
so you gotta keep going mom 
Shala I'm so glad you're working with me thank you so much for being here it's been so fun
first squad together come on
I love strength training it's something that's changed my life in so many different ways
"when I was able to see
how much stronger my body could be it was such a good reminder anytime anything was challenging for myself I could remember how I was able to take control and to make myself better and make myself stronger"
so that's why I love the strength train
almost fell over good thing I got my fireplace
yes squad come on Kersey you still with me
my heart rates up ah
come on stay with me
I see my Chicago families in the chat I love you guys I miss you all so much
I know I'm here in LA but Chicago will forever be my heart so I love you guys okay
see time flies by when you are having fun
so if you have any questions for me we're gonna answer them at the end of the chat cooldown
I can't even talk
now if you want to waddle over to your computer and ask you a question type it up
I'll answer when it is time for the cool down
come on promise your legs aren't gonna fall off
your legs are gonna feel like they're gonna fall but I promise they're gonna be there the whole time
okay they're keeping you up keeping you strong
happy thoughts happy thoughts come on squad
I love it so many different cities joining in a chat right now from all over the US and I know my toronto fam is here too
I say a little you know they might over involve something that's called a burpee and everyone was like no
you can give me some some good old Kirstie Gotso hot sauce burpees whatever you want
and I know it's so super Sam is in the chat working out with us and girl is gonna crush these burpees right now aren't you girl
I don't even know what day it is anymore you ready for those burpees
"happy thoughts I promise it's almost
over"
come on almost there up drop it down squad this is where it really counts I know you're tired but I'm right here with you
"I'm just as tired as you guys are come on but we do this together
knowing that we can all push together is what gets me motivated"
let the calm happy thoughts swell through your body because this is it
let's just take a little nap alright just kidding
oh Anthony has been feeling this playlist his question is how can you get this playlist
you can check out the Spotify link in the YouTube description
told you my girl kills it Filipinos
Julio wants to know what shoes I'm wearing he wants a pair
these are the super rep this is a great shoe for hiit
so today it was a perfect workout it even has this thing called the Burpee break that puts you in a really great position for the burpees that we were in
Michelle asked so she's been doing it beginner workouts in the app and wondering what other workouts she could do to get stronger
well if you haven't already done my kick it off program which is a really great total body beginner strength program
or anybody can really do it
Kirstey just released an awesome strengthen hit program that just came out
I also love the breakthrough challenge because it's a great holistic program with yoga animal flow strength and hiit
so there are tons of programs in there there's also a bunch of regular workouts that aren't in programs as well
so check them out alright
"oh I love this question what does it
mean to you to represent as an
asian-american woman and athlete"
I love this so much it's funny because this year was something was a year that I was like you know I really want to embrace being Who I am and where I came from
"and I was actually born in the
Philippines and I came to the US when I was only 2 years old"
"so obviously didn't remember the
Philippines very much"
I went for Christmas with my mom this past year for the first time and it was just so amazing to be able to get cultural touch with my culture but for me it's just really representing and being proud of everything that I do
and always remembering where it came from because you know my mom is such a big representation of all of my hard work and she's taught me everything
I really think it's because we came from the Philippines and I just like to be really proud of everything and I love Filipino food
and yeah I don't know if that really answers the question but yeah but anyway thank you everyone 
then we'll get that heart rate up a little bit
today's workout is a hundred percent low-impact
we have got some tough stuff coming today
it's ideal for new exercisers and people returning to exercise
and it features real body project members
enjoy
welcome to a real start plus
"engage, work through"
this is the big one
the real start plus workout today
and we have Wade and Angie Mullins with us and they're here to show you how it's done
"can't tell you how excited we are to
have these guys all the way over from Vermont USA"
the real Start Plus plan takes us further than the real start plan
Angie and Wade have both lost 60 pounds using body project workouts
and they're here to show us how it's done
real people real workouts real results
today we're just gonna enjoy ourselves
pause buttons there pause buttons your friend whenever you need to use it
that's a challenge but you guys have got to pick your place in there
doesn't mean you have to do the whole thing
I just want you to finish with us
enjoy moving your body today
enjoy being with us
and I hope you feel the same
feeling ready for this
you're feeling warm already
enjoying that march
I'll be honest I don't envy her one little bit
it's tough enough
all our impact everything we do here we will start is one low-impact and two standing
so you could be confident that you can be involved and work out the whole way through
that's different than saying you have to do every single moment
but you can be doing it with us
feeling this now already
I'm loving this
feel the energy from these guys
it is called real Star Plus
in case you're already a little bit upset with us for the speed and the intensity
but this is about taking your body on that bit further feel good
wherever you are if you need to break halfway through it's about progress not perfection
the physical body can do so much
that's what gets you through the moments
I know you can I know you will
I can feel it Angie and them weights all right
I so don't envy you
I practiced this workout the other day
I got about 20 seconds in with weights and I thought I'll give them to Angie
I don't think I can do that
not ready for that
it's tough enough as it is
as always at body project you can punch anyone you like
except Angie me or Wade that's off-limits as much as you might want to
feeling good we've got this we've got this
I might have lost everybody there but it's important to show you some different variations
that's the good news
feel the burn
believe in yourself
believe you can because you can and you will
this workout it's like an Everest
its here to find the place that you can
get to working through
good work there Wade loving that bud
how are you doing Angie good Angie
I've been wanting to do that for years ANGIE right
I don't think Angie likes me as much as she did before
working hard suck up the adrenaline
the clock keeps ticking
doesn't mean you have to
I hope you're enjoying today's workout
if you'd like to take part in the rest  of the real Start Plus plan with myself Angie and Wade
come and join us at teen body project.com
I don't really think it's fair to have the word just anywhere near this workout to be honest
but it's there it's there
loving the energy guys
both of them are good
we're winners we're winning this is the halfway mark
well they might have a cheeky surprise for everybody who knows
believe it or not I have designed this workout to be enjoyed
I have designed this workout for you guys to enjoy moving
I feel like a bit of a fibber
feeling that adrenaline working through now
this second half we're gonna put in even more than the first half
we're gonna really show how we can do it
how we can roll our best effort
your personal best effort not my best not Wade's best not Angie's best
if you need to pull up to come back
and love that
it's all winning every single moment that passes
this is the real start
if I were where you are right now and I didn't have these guys watching I'd be taking an extra cheeky break but I'm gonna go 
we know these hurt your mind
"you know what I call it, I call that change juice"
it hurts yes it burns yes
but there it is flowing through your body and changing your body
that's what matters that's what counts
taking it up a level with a real start plus today
"make no mistake about that this is
different gravy"
this is another gear yet
I want to see come on Wade
show me that game face
I am so dripping
feel like I'm standing under Niagara Falls
they're gonna feel the waterfalls of progress washing over us haha
there's not much in the tank now
low impact standing
who said you need high impact to get a fantastic heart raising super tough body changing life transforming workout
the active recoveries are making this level 4 work out
the official rating is 3 I'm going to tell you now that's the trick into you pressing play
I'll be honest I kind of make up a little bit of a lie to getting you in
this is no longer physical understand that
your body wants to give up it wants to stop
I'm not so sure right now
and I almost lost my bearings
because I want to keep the energy high
and I've got a little treat for you it's called run punch star
Angie's going high impact me and Wade we're going low
she's putting some punches in I love that spirit look at that
come on Wade all the way now bud
like thoroughbred horses we are running to it
that's how we feel that's who we are
Angie look at the speed
come on great job Angie great job
come here first-ever buddies project work out
how well did these guys do
it is like we've all been in the shower right
what a fantastic effort
that is what I call a kick off workout
I just figured if you're gonna be here of filming we might as well go in at the deep end right
we might as well just go in and get it done
how good does it feel now
how good do you feel having done that session today
we'll just let that heart rate come down
it takes a little while
I am honestly still struggling to get my breath back
that's how it's feeling
low-impact I'll say again all standing
that was a body changing change juice filled workout
and as long as you're here stretching with us
"if you marched through the
whole session that's great"
whether you did half of each section
whether you press pause 20 times
or 10 percent of each section it
doesn't matter because you can come back tomorrow and do a little bit more
never question yourself
every moment that you move your body is a step towards the outcome that you want
it's not gonna be dramatic
change comes because of consistent decisions and the day is a workout but done
however you did with it it is done
it is the win and nobody can take that away from you
now it's a win we've won
unless you're doing another workout and in that case I probably question your sanity
but that's up to you
lifting up above I am certainly done for the day
that's 100% and let's enjoy a nice hang here
over as we say luxuriating enjoying and relishing of victory and our own brilliance
what a great session
how you feeling Wade you're feeling good
how'd it go for you Angie
get that energy back in
you ready for this Wade
you ready Angie
