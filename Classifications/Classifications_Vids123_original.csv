single leg deadlift like an airplane,1
similar to our you eccentrics that we did with our push-ups and our split squats,1
yeah if you're still working on the balance stay where we were in that first round,1
but if you're feeling pretty good I want to see that glass break,1
now we go little plank rows,1
in a speed squat or a squat jump whatever you want to do,1
squat jumps or speed jumps,1
so sit back into Child's Pose,1
when I say hold you're gonna hold it in a squat ,1
burpees and plank,1
okay we're going one more time on those hinges,1
little march,1
the next exercise is gonna be a shoulder raise lunge,1
march whenever you have to,1
and a nice march,1
keep marching if you have to,1
we got straight punches,1
march it out ,1
and march,1
and march,1
next up we've got oblique crunches,1
"we're gonna move back into the hook and
knees",1
and march,1
we march,1
next up touching knee raises,1
you can pump the march for the good,1
marching on in to the power punches,1
and march,1
fast march or run power punches and stars,1
and march,1
keep marching keep moving,1
let's punch let's work,1
alright moving to the lower body,2
we just want to isolate the triceps on this one,2
no swinging because now all of a sudden all the other muscles are taking over,2
drive off those heels,2
squeeze the gluts up at the top,2
try your best not to hyperextend your back,2
to just come up until your upper body is in this nice straight line,2
make sure not to bounce your arms off the ground either,2
we're on to our feet for the next one,2
either way we're going to put our weight back in our hips little bend the knee,2
I'm going to go all the way down and I'm going to bring my hips forward and shrug,2
so we're driving our hips backwards all the way up hips forward and then shrug bringing your shoulders up to your ears,2
make sure you are driving thosehips back just a little bend in those knees and hips go back,2
just be sure to keep that core tight also,2
keep your core tight,2
shake those arms,2
both palms come up,2
we're going to curl those pinkies in on the way up and then all the way back down again,2
so we're gonna hit those biceps next,2
keep those shoulders back and square,2
we're both bending at the hips first,2
we're only going to bend at those elbows not moving the whole arm,2
keep your core tight and at the top you're squeezing that back of the arm,2
squeezing your triceps up at the top,2
notice we're using that elbow as a lever ,2
so we're not moving that upper arm just bend at the elbow,2
we're pulling back at those elbows keeping our core nice and tight,2
you don't want your back getting loose or allowing your abs to relax,2
so we're driving off the heels and squeezing our glutes and pressing up at the same time,2
right below your knees pop em and shrug taking the weight back on our hips feeling that stretch and up and shrug,2
and what feels comfortable don't take it to a place it feels awkward with your shoulders,2
core stays tight doesn't matter either one whichever one you're doing still stays tight,2
"curling both at the same time
",2
curling those pinkies in,2
back on our hips making sure to break at the hips every time,2
hips back then squat that's the key,2
keep those feet flat drive off the heels,2
elbows are up only bend at those elbows ,2
extend and squeeze that back of the arm,2
squeeze those triceps,2
you can bring your hands up then you won't have the stability from the ground,2
"so place the foot on
the ground",2
bend those knees and walk it out into a high plank position,2
you can bend those knees a little bit for a little more space,2
let's go ahead and take that foot outside of your hand,2
I want you to take the elbow down and then open it up,2
big spread through the chest,2
all the way up fully extend that leg back if you feel comfortable,2
let's place both hands on the ground,2
let's take the other foot outside,2
you can rest that knee or extend,2
bend those knees,2
walk those hands back,2
roll yourself up nice and slow,2
you can rest the knee on the ground,2
"we'll drive through
the heel ",2
shoulders are back,2
you can let that knee just go a little past your toe,2
you don't want to go too far forward so your heel comes up,2
just want to really drive through that front heel to bring yourself back to standing position,2
keeping the feet right where they are,2
alright you can be on your toes for this or you can be on your knees,2
remember you can be on your toes for these,2
now I want you to take your feet about hip width,2
so notice my back toe is in line with the back heel,2
stagger the foot chest up sit it back alright,2
so sitting back driving the knees out then we'll hinge and then bring it back up,2
quick feet quick feet,2
"all right bring those feet
down ",2
so if you want to make this harder take those feet more narrow,2
that knee I want it to go up as fast as you can,2
so first up we're gonna bring those shoulder blades off the ground,2
shoulder blades off the ground,2
okay so with these if you feel like they're feeling pretty challenging for you you can even bend those knees a little bit shorten that lever,2
or you can even bring the legs up a little bit higher,2
but whatever you're doing try to keep that hollow in your belly,2
keep a lot of tension,2
shoulder blades off the ground,2
now you can bend those knees,2
the fingertips are just grazing the back of your heels,2
here you're gonna peel your hips off the ground ,2
and then you're gonna dig one heel to the ground as you bring one knee to your chest,2
use your hands on the ground to give you some stability,2
arms close arms wide arms close arms wide,2
and really thinking about keeping the ribcage down and the tailbone tucked up,2
knees underneath the hips,2
we're gonna hover those knees nice and easy off the ground,2
hands press into the ground ,2
so look right past those fingertips ,2
"keep that tailbone tucked in
nice and strong",2
I want you to try to get those biceps by those ears,2
so again peeling the hips off the ground,2
bring that knee to your chest,2
keep those shoulders off the ground,2
if you didn't bring those hands up maybe try it this time,2
keep that tailbone tucked,2
alright peel those hips down nice and slow,2
now I want you to try to extend the opposite leg,2
keep that chest up,2
keep your body as stiff as you can,2
we're gonna bring one leg forward one leg back eccentric split squat now,2
keep those hips squared forward,2
so we're gonna bring one arm down by our armpit and one arm by our head,2
I'm focusing on driving my knees out as I sit back chest is up,2
so feet go more narrow than those hips sit in and then more of a sumo and out,2
so step those feet out as wide as you can ,2
keep that chest up keep that posture tall,2
move those feet move those feet,2
drive those elbows back and hold,2
keep the hip as level as you can,2
slight bend in the leg,2
so one leg is slightly bent,2
keep that back flat shoulders back,2
drive the elbows back towards your hips,2
hinge back flat,2
slight bend in the leg,2
chest up,2
look past those fingertips squeeze squeeze,2
keep that back flat drive it up,2
other side slight bend in the leg,2
tap those feet out now,2
get low keep that chest up,2
use those arms use your core to keep you strong,2
squeeze those quads,2
push energy through your heels,2
it's okay if you need to go to your knees,2
shoulders back keep it strong,2
slowly lower those legs down,2
"I want you to place your hands right
underneath your shoulders",2
peel yourself up and off the ground with the shoulders long down your back,2
squeeze your butt,2
and really reach through for those fingertips,2
feet a little wider than our hips,2
you can place your hands behind you for some stability,2
we're gonna drop the knees side to side,2
so now I want you to drop it to one side square yourself to the shin and then fold yourself forward,2
so nice active shoulders,2
all right swing those legs around,2
so we're going to turn our hips back,2
and when I say forward you're just gonna jump your feet forward and jump them back,2
let's get the knees up into the hands guys,2
get the core nice and tight,2
keep that core tight,2
let's get the hamstrings warm now,2
our way hands out in front,2
core tight and we open up ,2
core tight,2
really important we got that core engaged,2
we're gonna touch and raise into the right knee,2
so we touch one knee,2
keep that core strong,2
so we come we lift the left knee now,2
keep that core strong,2
core strong,2
so I like a little arm movement,2
"so the opposite hamstring we squeeze that
muscle between the knee and the bum it's called the hamstring",2
left hand first,2
core strong,2
keep that core strong,2
get that core strong,2
just go as low as you can and bring that knee up,2
let's get that core tight,2
touching touching knee opposite knee now,2
core strong,2
right foot planted,2
come on left foot planted,2
nice and strong core tight,2
core strong,2
little open up at the arms,2
stretch out right leg first with the quad core tight,2
core strong,2
so I'm going to be able to get a little bit deeper than doing the chair or box squat,3
all the way up all the way down,3
either way we're both pulling back on our elbows keeping those elbows tucked in nice and tight to the body,3
pulling back we're keeping our core tight and straight and our upper body is on a 45 degree angle,3
keep it going pulling back on those elbows keeping them tight to your body,3
we're going to go to the ground for the next one,3
we're going to drive off our heels and at the same time we're going to press the dumbbell straight up and back down,3
just going to come and bring the hands just below the knees and then repeat that same shrug,3
both of us are keeping our backs nice and straight on this movement,3
so we're not breaking that straight line and hunching over,3
but keeping our back straight while we're kicking those hips back,3
full range of motion on this one all the way up all the way down,3
we're going to curl those pinkies in on the way up and then all the way back down again,3
so that means we're not swinging up and flinging them back down,3
driving those hips back,3
and then coming down until our hips are parallel to the ground,3
I'm just touching the chair and coming right back up,3
" I'm not sitting not resting, or bouncing",3
"make sure you keep those knees out, don't allow them to break or compress in",3
so we're bent over,3
our elbows are up,3
we're going to the ground,3
we're going to reach up to the ceiling,3
we're bringing our shoulder blades off the ground and come back down,3
so we are contracting the ABS up at the top reaching up big and high,3
reaching up don't bounce off the ground stay under control,3
again pulling back on those elbows,3
driving off the heels pressing straight up,3
we're up on our feet,3
right below your knees pop em and shrug taking the weight back on our hips feeling that stretch and up and shrug,3
bring those dumbbells down to about in line with your ears maybe just a little bit lower really depends on your flexibility,3
driving through curl those pinkies in shoulders are back,3
not swinging the weights not getting a bunch of momentum involved,3
it means we're going to the ground,3
reaching up to the ceiling squeeze in those ABS up at the top,3
I'm going to grab my dumbbells,3
going to the ground,3
pull lower down ,3
"it's totally fine to be on your knees, do what form that challenges you ",3
"so place the foot on
the ground",3
move those feet forward,3
 tap tap,3
"so let's just go ahead and
meet back at the mat here if you have one",3
big reach up nice and high,3
rock forward and back maybe on those wrists a little bit,3
maybe side to side and then walk your hands back ,3
big reach up take it back down,3
big reach up maybe straighten out those legs a little bit more,3
let's go ahead and take that foot outside of your hand,3
I want you to take the elbow down and then open it up,3
"big reach  big spread through the
chest take it back down",3
try to reach to the ceiling,3
 take it back down,3
all the way up fully extend that leg back if you feel comfortable,3
or you can keep it on the ground,3
let's place both hands on the ground,3
so stepping it back ,3
bring it back together,3
now I want you to take your feet about hip width,3
"all right bring those feet
down ",3
so sit it back hinge it forward,3
that knee I want it to go up as fast as you can,3
all right tap it out,3
forward,3
so first up we're gonna bring those shoulder blades off the ground,3
shoulder blades off the ground,3
arms close arms wide arms close arms wide,3
and really thinking about keeping the ribcage down and the tailbone tucked up,3
so we'll swing it on around,3
we're gonna hover those knees nice and easy off the ground,3
hands press into the ground ,3
if you feel pretty good on these we're gonna tap down and the tap behind your head,3
tap down tap behind your head,3
dig into the floor,3
so now we're standing up,3
push yourself up,3
feet moving fast,3
"so now we're gonna bring it
back to standing",3
make sure your body's in a straight line,3
let's bring ourselves up ,3
we're staying at the same side,3
lower is not necessarily better on these,3
so keep it straight keep it forward,3
and then get it out nice and narrow still setting those hips back,3
this time I'm going to say side and when I say side you're gonna jump to the side and bring it back to center,3
but we're gonna all jump to your right,3
now we go to the other side,3
so when I say you're gonna pull and hold and then you'll switch when I say,3
so if you want to make it easier you could bring your feet wider or you can bring them more narrow to make it more challenging,3
so the wider your feet are the more stability you have,3
hinge slow and then drive it up,3
from your head all the way to your leg you're straight,3
so your posture is strong shoulders are back,3
keep that back flat shoulders back,3
now we're gonna go back into the ground,3
switch lower down slow ,3
drive the elbows back towards your hips,3
so we're gonna go slow slow slow and then drive it up,3
 drive it up,3
drive it up,3
all right other side,3
all right drive it up,3
drive it up okay,3
pull pull,3
hinge slow break the glass,3
keep that back flat drive it up,3
other side slight bend in the leg,3
we'll try to get a little explosion,3
tap those feet out now,3
we got to go the other way on those switches,3
quick feet with those hips switches going the other way,3
and when I say hold we'll hold it low,3
get low keep that chest up,3
don't just throw yourself on the ground,3
peel yourself up and off the ground with the shoulders long down your back,3
so really try to actively push in the ground ,3
push your top of your feet to the ground,3
peel yourself up off the ground,3
you can place your hands behind you for some stability,3
we're gonna drop the knees side to side,3
side square yourself to the shin,3
and then fold yourself forward,3
go ahead and flip it over to the other side ,3
same thing square yourself forward,3
all right swing those legs around,3
all right let's get that explosive push right,3
so we're going to turn our hips back,3
and when I say forward you're just gonna jump your feet forward and jump them back,3
big reach up ,3
if you're feeling really fancy on these last one squad and maybe you can be able to jump at the top,3
when we speed it up if you want to go plyo go for it,3
 or if you are like I don't feel like jumpin  and just move a little faster okay,3
we're just gonna move the feet as quick as we can,3
alright so just move as fast as you can forward only when I say forward,3
so when I say switch you move those hips one direction only ready,3
it's all standing,3
little dip,3
our way hands out in front,3
and we're gonna dip and reach,3
next one is a touch and knee raise,3
we're gonna touch and raise into the right knee,3
so we touch one knee,3
punch someone,3
it's the touch and knee raise,3
coming to the left,3
keep marching,3
so we come we lift the left knee now,3
and march it out,3
other side,3
remember the lower you go the tougher it is,3
if you feel a twinge in your lower back just stop immediately,3
keep marching,3
and we throw a punch out,3
you can put a little dip in there as well if you want,3
it's gonna be two crunches on each side,3
remember you can pump out the march or you can just walk it out,3
left hand first,3
remember you do not have to touch the floor,3
just go as low as you can and bring that knee up,3
you aim them right down the pipe,3
all the way out now,3
all the way out,3
come on all the way out all the way out,3
touching touching knee opposite knee now,3
you've got that sidestep,3
the other side the other side,3
little side steps now,3
then change over to the other side,3
you're gonna find that that build up is intense through the planted leg,4
"not the one that you're raising, right",4
so you're really then get that action on the oblique,4
it's the standing leg that gets that deep burn,4
like a nice stretch through the quads,4
with that squat you're bending those knees feeling it more in those quads,4
and that hinge you should feel in the back of those legs ,4
I want you to pretend like you're pushing the ground away from you here,4
you should feel it more in that front leg but you definitely will feel it a little bit in that back especially in that hip flexor,4
you might notice your ankles are like oh whoa wobbly it's okay,4
pretend like you're pushing something that's invisible into the ground,4
like you're like pushing something away from you but you can't see it I know you can see it but I can't,4
so I want you to pretend like you're breaking glass at the top,4
we'll try to get a little explosion,4
so I want you to feel the difference between these two movements,4
"yes we're focusing on our
legs but you still want to think about those back muscles to keep that nice strong posture",4
make sure you're actually being really aware of your body right now,4
feel those muscles contracting all the way up and all the way down,4
if you're not feeling a stretch in the back of your leg then I want you to ,4
so we're getting your hamstrings your glutes your lower back your abs chest shoulders triceps the list goes on,4
getting a lot of different body parts worked in this one,4
feel that stretch in your hamstrings,4
"this one we are getting
hamstrings glutes lower back and your traps",4
this one really hits that whole posterior chain,4
feeling those ABS start to work that's a good thing that's the feeling of improvement right there,4
"start with your best guess but don't just keep the weight if  you're not able to complete the reps in
a safe manner",5
or the other way if it's not challenging you make sure to up the weight so you can get that full benefit,5
feel free to adjust the weight as you go through it,5
and again on any of these don't feel like you have to use the same weight for all of them,5
"Claudia's going to lose her weights, I'm going to keep mine though",5
"Claudia is going to
grab her box or if you have a chair that
works as well",5
"now that weight of the dumbbells is
going to be totally determined by your
current fitness level",5
"just remember it's much better to start light and work your way up than the
other way around",5
she's going to be using one dumbbell I'm going to use two so that's the main difference,5
I'm gonna grab my box over here,5
"Claudia's going to grab her box and I'm going to do this one from a standing
position",5
"yeah exactly she's only gonna use
one weight good point",5
you notice how she's holding the weight up with two hands and I got a my thumbs out,5
you see I'm using my weights making it more difficult Claudia she's just using her body weight,5
Claudia's gonna keep one,5
"the only 5
required for this workout is a pair of
dumbbells",5
the only other 5 that you may want for this workout is a chair or a box,5
need both weights again,5
"we're going to need both
weights for this one",5
you could also just use one weight if you wanted to,5
if you want to do the modified version I'm also going to lose a dumbbell here,5
grab your seat if you got one,5
you need both weights for this next one,5
if you are using a weight that you can just do 100 reps in this 30-second time period then you need to up the weight,5
you don't want to fling or swing the dumbbells around,5
so if you're doing your shoulder press seated feel free to grab it ,5
all you need is yourself a mat if you have one of course some water because we're really gonna get after it today,5
get that water use that towel if you need to,5
you can have weights with you like Angie,5
you've got that water you've got that towel at any time you can go to it,5
water if you need it,5

hit those triceps next,11
so we're going into our squats weights ,11
"it's going to be a combo
movement",11
another combo movement,11
so we're hitting the biceps next,11
one right into the next using good form ,11
we're going back to the upper body,11
and we're going to go right into those reach crunches,11
finishing strong okay,11
we're going to finish up with some ABS,11
and we're gonna have an option to go plyo jumping from in and out,11
we're going back to those hollow holds but this time we're gonna change it up a little bit,11
we're changing it up now,11
and then you're just gonna warm yourself up,11
I'll give you one version for the first round and then each round I'll add on a little progression,11
alright switch it up other side,11
last time on the bridge march,11
we are only moving through two different movement patterns,11
so we're lowering down at my count then driving through the heel my count,11
now we go to the other side,11
this is the last round,11
this is round one of three,11
so we're not done yet we're not done yet,11
okay so we're gonna go to a burpee,11
we're back to burpees in three two one,11
we have one more round last round best round right now,11
so warm up feeling good we're gonna go to a nice little core set to start,11
we're getting close to the end,11
come on alright push-ups or burpees first,11
we're going to go back to those fast feet,11
you ready here we go,11
now I want you to row fast okay,11
all right you're with me this is the last time on these squats,11
you ready here we go,11
all right you ready,11
so guess what it's time for our finisher,11
what we're gonna do now is I'm gonna give you a hold,11
okay so this is one of two finishers,11
we're almost there,11
we've got another litter little finisher,11
then we'll go with a little core,11
then we'll take it to a strength set,11
alright team now we're going back to our strength section,11
alright so now we're going up to those hinges,11
you ready join me now,11
so this first round we're going to eccentric,11
all right bridge march now,11
we're gonna go to some quick feet,11
we're just gonna start to bounce side to side,11
then we'll start  interweaving that little agility set I got for you and then boom we'll have a finisher then I'll answer some of your questions then we'll be done,11
we'll take it to two different movement patterns here,11
we're going back to the push-up set for this,11
now we're going into a narrow and wide push-up,11
so we will revisit this hinge later on in a single leg position,11
so we're moving into our strength set,11
so now we're going back to those fast feet,11
we're kind of doing it now,11
take a few seconds gather yourself,11
we are almost there,11
20 seconds and we're gonna move straight into that hooking knee,11
with me hooking knee there we go,11
"we're gonna go over to the other side in
three two one",11
fortunately we've got a little bit of time off cardio now,11
it's coming next,11
we're gonna go runs stars and then I want to see punches like Bruce Muhammad Ali,11
and then punch like you mean it,11
ready you might want to march slow,11
oh I'm really sorry about this guy's we're doing it again,11
but I'm changing the order,11
but please as always you can pause whenever you want to,11
you can take a break whenever you need to,11
take an extra break whenever you need to,11
that is what I call an intense punching session,11
I can see the finish line I mean it's not right there but we're getting there up next,11
the bad news is we've got some more tough work on the legs with some sidestep resistance,11
next up touching knee raises,11
and we're straight in punches let's go,11
then change over to the other side,11
we're actually switching out the last exercise which was obliques before,11

power power,13
this time two hands on one she'll go,14
I'm going to squeeze these together and I'm going to pull back and Claudia is just going to interlock her fingers and pull back,14
Claudia is going to show you an RDL which stands for Romanian deadlift,14
good and notice how,14
move this out of the way,14
Claudia's going to give you a nice side view,14
"I'll give you guys a side view here
squatting",14
so what I mean by that is you're not going here right,14
 because if you don't what happens is you bend at the knees first and you end up here,14
"remember this is it right here what are
you saving it for don't save anything",14
"put it all out there right now right
here right now let's go nice work nice
work",14
here we go rep by rep getting closer to the end closer to  that finish line almost there,14
so we're gonna go here and then we'll switch,14
open it up alright,14
so hovering off the ground tap and tap so balance something on your hips,14
"relax, go and slow those hips down bring it on up",14
let's swing it on around alright,14
let's go ahead and place the hand down,14
how can you go,14
so everything stays here and then everything stays wide,14
arms are wide arms are narrow,14
stay with me here,14
we're going this way now,14
so be in this plank position row row,14
join me come on come on,14
how fast can you bring it back to center,14
right stay with me,14
I want to stay there,14
you ready all right,14
I want to stay there you ready all right,14
now up stick it hinge,14
so it's like a little fancy dance move so you switch nice,14
just like this,14
let's stay low,14
you can walk it out walk it in and up whatever you want to do or you can jump,14
just hold it,14
I just want you to super strong on these,14
step it step it in whatever you got,14
we're gonna sit with our feet in front of us like we're just chilling out like this,14
when you're here if you feel good or you can just stay here I'm okay with that,14
we're getting close,14
give you a little leverage because you want to keep the hips nice and stable as you're moving through these,14
because the focus here is the lowering faze,14
it's okay we do it,14
looking good their way,14
which is going to be here,14
as well that's fine you can kind of stand to like this,14
come on come on,14
come back in,14
here we are,14
here we stand,14
power feeling that,14
all the way out now,14
all the way out,14
look at that speed and power,14
that's drive,14
I gotta keep going,14
all the way all the way all the way out Angie all the way out,14
we're just here to move,14
squeezing that muscle down here,14
we're going to get right back into it all right,15
that doesn't give you much time,15
but it's a very efficient movement,15
"so from the box it's a little easier, standing a little harder, standing  it forces me to use a little bit more  stability and a little bit more core",15
this is about that point in the workout where you start to really feel it,15
it starts to kick in and it becomes all mental right now,15
arms are 6 to get a little bit of lactic acid built up in them,15
this is a strength training routine so we don't want to I know you said work at your own pace but we definitely don't want to make this a cardio and just start pumping out,15
stay nice and under control,15
this one's under control ,15
just to mix up your weight find what weight works for you on this one,15
try to keep the pace up a little bit faster for the second round because we know what we're doing,15
and then switch it out,15
you're not just moving through the motions,15
good so nice and quick,15
yup come on are you quick are you quick,15
so these metrics are so great because you can feel every single muscle in your body,15
"you can make sure you're doing
the form right",15
we activated our core and our glutes a lot,15
those are hard,15
keep it strong,15
nice and easy,15
yeah it's nice and easy nice and controlled,15
so you want to make sure you're focusing on keeping everything squeezed everything active,15
nice and wide nice and narrow,15
keep them nice and stable,15
so still keeping that hollow through your belly keeping it nice and strong,15
we got to stick it okay,15
"gotta stick that
landing",15
we'll kind of stick that landing,15
so keep it strong,15
you feeling warm,15
working through,15
remember this workout is designed to be tough,15
dig,15
keep working keep going,15
dig dig dig,15
keep working,15
keep working through,15
yeah you're feeling good,15
work it through,15
we got it we got it,15
come on big effort big effort,15
come on work through,15
this is tough stuff this is real stuff,15
engage we got it we can,15

feeling it working through,15
stay with it dig,15
yeah let's get stretched off,15
let's dig let's work,15
be strong,15
be strong,15
now work it through,15
pushing through dig in it,15
don't worry if it takes you a second to get it,15
focusing focus it,15
stay with it,15
so keeping nice and strong,15
focus good crisp movements good form,15
get them punches out powerfully,15
your best punches,15
and I want these to be your best punches,15
not your second best punches I want them to be your best,15
"I want to see the very most powerful punches
you've got",15
but this time if you feel really good we're going to hollow rocks,16
this time we're going hip switches,16
maybe you got a tuck jump Burpee I don't know,16
we've got hamstring punches now,16
hamstring punches,16
and stars,16
