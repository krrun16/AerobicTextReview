core tight
bring up your knee up to hips level 
we're planking with the tap next 
keep your core engaged 
try not to sway too much
for low impact just do the lunge only without the jump 
let's do the same on the other side 
core tight back neutral and all muscles activate it
for low impact just bring one leg out at one time and bring them back in 
you can do just a crunch only for the low impact version 
shuffle to one side and crunch and then to the other side
squat low guys work those legs and back and also your abs 
for low impact you can just take a step without the hop 
do it slow and steady if you need to  
make sure your butt is not poking up and squeeze those abs 
if this is too hard you can do a side plank hold 
start in a side plank 
then kick the top light in front of you 
then bring the leg back and get into a tabletop position
and kick the other leg up touching your hand
make sure your core is engaged 
start with push-up and then touch your toe with your opposite hand
if you can't do a regular push-up you can start with just toe tap only that eventually you can add some push-ups or you can try knee push-ups 
this works your legs butt and abs at the same time 
make sure your core is tight 
starting high planking 
then jump feet in and out and in again 
then get up and do another jump off the ground 
bring your knee up to a hip level
do it as fast as you can you can do it
for low impact just raise the knee up without the jump 
for low-impact you can just do the squat 
bring up the speed for low impact you can just take it slow
