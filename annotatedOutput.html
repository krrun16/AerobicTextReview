<p>
hey everybody it's your personal trainer coach kozak here from hasfit. and i'm claudia and this is our beginner weight training routine this routine is great for both men and women of a beginner fitness level the only equipment required for this workout is a pair of dumbbells now that weight of the dumbbells is <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> be totally determined by your current fitness level just remember it's much better to <br><br><span style="background-color:#eb8034">start</span> light and work your way up than the other way around the only other equipment that you may want for this workout is a chair or a box for some of the modified movements we're <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> do the whole thing with you ready to get this thing going all right we're <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> <br><br><span style="background-color:#eb8034">start</span> with either a dumbbell crusher or a dumbbell t-row so if you want to do the easier modified versions you go and follow claudia she's <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> be using one dumbbell i'm <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> use two so that's the main difference i'm <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> squeeze these together and i'm <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> pull back and claudia is just <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> interlock her fingers and pull back either way we're both pulling back on our elbows keeping those elbows tucked in nice and tight to the body pulling back we're keeping our core tight and straight and our upper body is on a 45 degree angle <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">now we</span>'re not <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> count any <span style="background-color:#a8cce0">repetition</span>s today i just want you to try to perform as many moves as you can in <span style="background-color:#c79d12">allotted <span style="background-color:#c79d12">time period</span></span> work at your own pace but at the same time be sure to push yourself because nobody else can do it for you breathe nice work keep it going pulling back on those elbows keeping them tight to your body in five four <span style="background-color:#c79d12">three two and one</span> okay we're <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> go to the ground for the <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">next one</span> it's <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> be a combo movement we're <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> need both weights for this one we're <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> do a hip up plus chest press we're <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> drive off our heels and at the same time we're <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> press the dumbbell straight up and back down getting a lot of different body parts worked in this one so we're getting your hamstrings your glutes your lower back your abs chest shoulders triceps the list goes on but it's a very efficient movement getting a lot of work in in a short period of time drive off those heels squeeze the gluts up at the top try your best not to hyperextend your back to just come up until your upper body is in this nice straight line and make sure not to bounce your arms off the ground either nice work breathe one right into the next moving at a pace that you feel comfortable with you got it <span style="background-color:#c79d12">almost there</span> let's go <span style="background-color:#a8cce0">five more</span><span style="background-color:#c79d12"> second</span>s on this one and four <span style="background-color:#c79d12">three two one</span> <span style="background-color:#ebdc34">and done</span><br><br> okay <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">we're on to</span> our feet for the <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">next one</span> need both weights <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">again</span> we're <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> either do a stiff leg deadlift plus shrug or claudia is <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> show you an rdl which stands for romanian deadlift i didn't make that up plus shrug either way we're <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> put our weight back in our hips little bend the knee i'm <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> go all the way down and i'm <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> bring my hips forward and shrug claudia's just <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> come and bring her hands just below her knees and then <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">repeat</span> that same shrug so we're driving our hips backwards all the way up hips forward and then shrug bringing your shoulders up to your ears feel that stretch in your hamstrings if you're not feeling a stretch in the back of your leg then i want to make sure you are driving those hips back just a little bend in those knees and hips go back <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">again</span> <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">another</span> combo movement this one we are getting hamstrings glutes lower back and your traps good and notice how both of us are keeping our backs nice and straight on this movement so we're not breaking that straight line and hunching over but keeping our back straight while we're kicking those hips back you got it <span style="background-color:#c79d12">almost done</span> with this one five four three two and <span style="background-color:#a8cce0">last one</span> zero nice okay so we're <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">move on</span> to some shoulder presses next i'm gonna grab my box over here claudia's <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> grab her box and i'm <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> do this one from a standing position so from the box it's a little easier standing a little harder standing it forces me to use a little bit more stability and a little bit more core but overall very comparable movements you decide which one is right for you if you don't feel comfortable the overhead quite yet grab a seat full range of motion on this one all the way up all the way down stay nice and under control you don't want to fling or swing the dumbbells around keep your core tight this is a strength training routine so we don't want to i know you said work at your own pace but we definitely don't want to make this a cardio and just <br><br><span style="background-color:#eb8034">start</span> pumping out correct exactly reps if you are using a weight that you can just do 100 reps in this 30-second <span style="background-color:#c79d12">time period</span> then you need to up the weight nice okay not much <span style="background-color:#c79d12">time left</span> on this one and five four <span style="background-color:#c79d12">three two and one</span> nice all right shake those arms move this out of the way and we're <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> move into a dumbbell curl so we're gonna hit those biceps next working on the gun show claudia's got a gun show with her tank top on tonight look at those guns anyway just admiring my wife's guns okay so we're <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> do a curl both palms come up we're <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> curl those pinkies in on the way up and then all the way back down <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">again</span> this one's under control so that means we're not swinging up and flinging them back down right that defeats the purpose but instead i feel that time under tension feel those muscles contracting all the way up and all the way down you got it good claudia's <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> give you a nice side view keep those shoulders back and square mm-hmm you got it we're breathing just 10 more<span style="background-color:#c79d12"> second</span>s left on this one fight through you got it and <span style="background-color:#c79d12">three two one</span> and zero alright <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">moving to</span> the lower body claudia is <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> grab her box or if you have a chair that works as well if you want to do the modified version i'm also <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> lose a dumbbell here yeah exactly she's only gonna use one weight good point so she's <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> do a goblet squat you notice how she's holding the weight up with two hands and i got a my thumbs out i'm gonna do a dumbbell squat just at my side so i'm <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> be able to get a little bit deeper than doing the chair or box squat but either way we're both bending at the hips first driving those hips back and then coming down until our hips are parallel to the ground all the way up all the way down and i'm just touching the chair and coming right back up i'm not sitting not resting exactly or bouncing that's the other thing right correct i'll give you guys a side view here squatting make sure you keep those knees out don't allow them to break or compress in nice work not much left on this one i know your legs are probably <br><br><span style="background-color:#eb8034">start</span>ing to feel it i didn't forget about you we got five four <span style="background-color:#c79d12">three two and one</span> done okay we're <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">move on</span> to a dumbbell tricep kickback we're gonna hit those triceps next save movement really just to mix up your weight find what weight works for you on this one so we're bent over our elbows are up we're only <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> bend at those elbows not moving the whole arm keep your core tight and at the top you're squeezing that back of the arm squeezing your triceps up at the top nice work notice we're using that elbow as a lever so we're not moving that upper arm just bend at the elbow so what i mean by that is you're not going here right no swinging no swinging because now all of a sudden all the other muscles are taking over we just want to isolate the triceps on this one you got it ten more<span style="background-color:#c79d12"> second</span>s that's it guys are doing great thank you so much for joining us today and for all of your hard work and <span style="background-color:#c79d12">three two one</span> <span style="background-color:#ebdc34">and done</span><br><br> okay we're <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> the ground losing my weights claudia's <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> lose her weights i'm <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> keep mine though we're <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> do a dumbbell reach crunch so from a crunch position we're <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> our feet on the ground we're <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> reach up to the ceiling we're bringing our shoulder blades off the ground and come back down so we are contracting the abs up at the top reaching up big and high you see i'm using my weights making it more difficult claudia she's just using her body weight you could also just use one weight if you wanted to that's right so <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">again</span> it's all about making this your own coming back <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">repeat</span>ing it getting a little bit better every single time and that's how we improve that consistency nice work reaching up don't bounce off the ground stay under control you got it nice work nice work we got 10 more<span style="background-color:#c79d12"> second</span>s on this one feeling those abs <br><br><span style="background-color:#eb8034">start</span> to work that's a good thing that's the feeling of improvement right there and <span style="background-color:#c79d12">three two one</span> and zero okay we're <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> rest that's the end of the <br><br><span style="background-color:#eb8034">first round</span> we got <span style="background-color:#a8cce0">one more</span> to go all right so it's a quick 20<span style="background-color:#c79d12"> second</span> break that doesn't give you much time if you want feel free to grab some water shake it loose take a couple deep breaths we're <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> get right back into it all right so we got ten<span style="background-color:#c79d12"> second</span>s i'm <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> grab my dumbbells we're <br><br><span style="background-color:#eb8034">getting ready</span> we're <br><br><span style="background-color:#eb8034">start</span>ing with the row we're gonna i'm doing my crusher row claudia's doing her t row and here we go we're pulling back at those elbows keeping our core nice and tight and if you're wondering why we didn't take a longer break even though we're beginners that's because the workout specifically designed to allow some muscles to rest while others are working so right now our backs working but at the same time our chest may be resting allows us to get a lot done in a short period of time <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">again</span> pulling back on those elbows anytime you're doing a row you want it to be like you have a string attached to your elbows and you're just pulling back on it just be sure to keep that core tight also exactly you don't want your back getting loose or allowing your abs to relax <span style="background-color:#c79d12">almost there</span> on this one let's go five four <span style="background-color:#c79d12">three two and one</span> all right <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> the ground you need both weights for this <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">next one</span> doing that hip up plus chest press so we're driving off the heels and squeezing our glutes and pressing up at the same time nice work and <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">again</span> on any of these don't feel like you have to use the same weight for all of them feel free to adjust the weight as you go through it <br><br><span style="background-color:#eb8034">start</span> with your best guesss but don't just keep the weight if  you're not able to complete the reps in a safe manner or the other way if it's not challenging you make sure to up the weight so you can get that full benefit nice work driving off the heels pressing straight up keep it up guys <span style="background-color:#c79d12">almost there</span> and five four <span style="background-color:#c79d12">three two one</span> zero we're up on our feet and try to keep the pace up a little bit faster for the<span style="background-color:#c79d12"> second</span> round because we know what we're doing we're <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> stiff leg deadlift or rdl plus shrug kick back right below your knees pop em and shrug taking the weight back on our hips feeling that stretch and up and shrug nice work this one really hits that whole posterior chain so important i always say in your front are the show muscles in the back are the go muscles basically means all your power and real athleticism comes from your backside come on keep it up you got it nice work not many left let's go <span style="background-color:#a8cce0">five more</span><span style="background-color:#c79d12"> second</span>s that's it and four <span style="background-color:#c79d12">three two one</span> and zero <span style="background-color:#ebdc34">finishing</span><br><br> strong okay grab your seat if you got one so if you're doing your shoulder press  seated feel free to grab it otherwise kicking them up getting right into it bring those dumbbells down to about in line with your ears maybe just a little bit lower really depends on your flexibility and what feels comfortable don't take it to a place it feels awkward with your shoulders nice work core stays tight doesn't matter either one whichever one you're doing still stays tight nice work this is about that point in the workout where you <br><br><span style="background-color:#eb8034">start</span> to really feel it it <br><br><span style="background-color:#eb8034">start</span>s to kick in and it becomes all mental right now not even physical it's all up in your head it's all that mental toughness and grip that's <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> keep you moving and fighting through rep by rep let's go come on and five four <span style="background-color:#c79d12">three two one</span> zero ahh all right feeling good <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">moving on</span> to a dumbbell curl so we're hitting the biceps next let's get it both curling at the same time curling those pinkies in there we go arms are <br><br><span style="background-color:#eb8034">start</span>ing to get a little bit of lactic acid built up in them remember you don't have to listen to that that's just a pain signal but the muscles got plenty left you got this come on driving through curl those pinkies in shoulders are back nice work one right into the next using good form not swinging the weights not getting a bunch of momentum involved <span style="background-color:#c79d12">almost there</span> let's go <span style="background-color:#a8cce0">five more</span><span style="background-color:#c79d12">

dumbbell squat or a dumbbell goblet squat from the chair i'll clean that name up later okay so we're going into our squats weights back on our hips making sure to break at the hips every time because if you don't what happens is you bend at the knees first and you end up here and then you're like oh man my knees hurt hips back then squat that's the key keep those feet flat drive off the heels nice work you got it every squat you do you're <br><br><span style="background-color:#c6a8e3">going to</span> get that much better at it nobody <br><br><span style="background-color:#eb8034">start</span>s
