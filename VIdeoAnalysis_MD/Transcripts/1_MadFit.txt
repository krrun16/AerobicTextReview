hello everybody welcome back thank you 
so much for joining me today we are 
doing 
a beginner style 15 minute full body 
cardio workout with 
no equipment so all you need today is 
yourself 
and a little bit of space around you the 
way that this workout is structured 
today is we are going to have 
three mini circuits within our 15 minute 
workout 
each of the exercises are going to be 30 
seconds 
each and we're not going to be taking 
any rest at all 
during the next 15 minutes but i promise

screen 
so you can follow along with me and 
without further ado 
let's get to it 
all right guys we're starting off nice 
and simple just with a 
jog in place like so 
you can bring those feet up to kick your 
bum

keep that core nice and tight and keep 
those arms moving 
[Music] 
all right next up we're just gonna do 
some marches in place
