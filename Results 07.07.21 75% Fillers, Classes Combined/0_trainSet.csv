hi be fitters I'm your coach today Allie Cohen,12
whatever level you're at you and me together let's go,12
how fun is it that we get to work out together all of us every single week bringing you live workouts from our living room,12
good work there Wade loving that bud,12
so this week we've been thinking about new perspectives and what I have had to really think about this time is changing things and looking at everything as an opportunity you know,12
every moment that you move your body is a step towards the outcome that you want,12
we have got some tough stuff coming today,12
good work Wade loving that extra effort,12
however you did with it it is done,12
I'm feeling it with you buddy,12
come on almost there up drop it down squad,12

except Angie me or Wade that's off-limits as much as you might want to,12
nice work,12
believe it or not I have designed this workout to be enjoyed,12
so today it was a perfect workout it even has this thing called the Burpee break that puts you in a really great position for the burpees that we were in,12
I can feel it Angie and them weights all right,12
I might have lost everybody there but it's important to show you some different variations,12
that's what gets you through the moments,12
feeling ready for this,12
you ready Michelle ,12
you're a winner and you're win,12
come on keep it up you got it nice work,12
and if you're wondering why we didn't take a longer break even though we're beginners that's because the workout specifically designed to allow some muscles to rest while others are working,12
remember I said while one body parts resting the others working,12
you're feeling good virtual high fives right now okay,12
come on come on Wade,12
