so we've got a built-in warmup we're gonna start off with that 45 on 15 seconds rest structure but we're going to start nice and light so that we like i said we have a built-in warmup so go ahead and get your feet moving,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
we're gonna start off with sidestep jacks so nice and light start on one side,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
just step out,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
and so you're doing the motion of a jumping jack with your arms but you're just kind of tapping lightly from side to side instead of jumping so increasingly these intervals are gonna get sweatier and sweatier,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt

little bunch is quite easy while our muscles are warming up,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt

so at least a boxer shuffle,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
you can always make it harder if you need to,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
we're doing those kind of forces you to get a good stretch to all the way down,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt

bend your knees until you can get to the floor,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
your hamstrings are tight,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
ten seconds left five seconds all right,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
now we're going back to that,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
second round of those sidestep jacks so,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
keep your feet moving for a little arm work in there,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
as well for that warm-up two one here we go just side to side enjoy the easy stuff,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
won't last make sure you're sitting up nice and tall to make you good posture,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
while you're doing these exercises make sure you're not doing kind of half half-hearted jumping jack motion keep your arms straight try to move slower if you have to and get the full range of motion instead of doing a quick no not full effort version 10 seconds left to one all right,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
get this key moving,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
putting down into those walk down back bows five seconds,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
two one here we go,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
i know i use variation of walk downs and my routines often because i love them they feel good but they work so many different muscles,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
there's a lot of different ways you can modify them about,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
20 seconds left 10 seconds to 1 all right so next up we are doing two knee,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
pulls so we're still and that low-impact lower-intensity warmup period,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
but we're going to start picking up here after this so again if this is too easy step up the intensity of your rest otherwise here we are so,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
we're one two one two so this is nice and low impact,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
if you want to step it up mm-hmm just add in some jumps,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
you can always make things easier or harder as you need to otherwise we just hear all about what works for you go over halfway done,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
try to get a little crunch,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
flex your core while you're doing this is definitely an abs exercise as well as a cardio exercise about five seconds left all right,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
next up we're doing a lunge plus a rotation five seconds left,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
here we go so we drop down into that lunge rotate rotate in the center,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
we just come back up so your legs are probably,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
can you start burning we are holding,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
that lunge you're also working your core about halfway already if you're not feeling very warmed up yet or if you're new to exercise you can just keep your lunge nice and shallow and just kind of step forward instead of a really deep lunge but if you want to make it harder sink down into it,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
i'm here here center,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
two one all right fifteen seconds,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
rest so if you're not sweating at all you know we're several minutes and at this point we're quite good ways in so you can start to really step up those intensities of both the intervals and your rest periods all right - knee pulls so like i said the harder version start jumping around and you can always mix it - so if you're here and you start to get winded well your motions start to get sloppy,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
take it back down and honestly the combination of both is a really great way to make pretty much any routine,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
you work for yourself and to improve your fitness really well because you can always alter it modify it and push yourself when you need to and then lay back when off in intensity a little bit,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
but you're not stopping just five seconds left all right so we're doing that lunge with rotation like i said even more bit challenge,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
step up your best best intervals,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
two one here we go sit down turn to each side come back up so after this point of the routine now that you're nice and warmed up you can also make it quite a lot harder by adding weight so holding onto weights while you do,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
this kind of stuff makes it a lot,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
more difficult got about 20 seconds left ten five right next up,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
we're doing two jumping,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
jacks plus a lateral,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
jump here so this is one of those exercises to make you feel a little bit uncoordinated but that's the whole point,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
i'm teaching your brain to pay attention to what you're moving so two jumping jacks plus from the center,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
do your jobs here,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
so you'll notice i'm doing my first lateral jump on a different side each time,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt

the next time i'm going to get more comfortable sky to jump further and further on each side to one my right next up,,,,Video_8_FitnessBlender.txt
