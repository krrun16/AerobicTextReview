it's funny because this year was something was a year that i was like you know,1
i'm niagara falls,1
i'm loving this,1
these are the super rep,1
i really want to embrace being who i am and where i came from and i was actually born in the philippines and i came to the us when i was only 2 years old so obviously didn't remember the philippines very much and i went for christmas with my mom this past year for the first time and it was just so amazing to be able to get cultural touch with my culture but for me it's just really representing and being proud of everything that i do and always remembering where it came from because you know my mom is such a big representation of all of my hard work and she's taught me everything and i really think it's because we came from the philippines and i just like to be really proud of everything and i love filipino,1
see time flies by when you are having fun,1
it even has this thing called the burpee break that puts you in a really great position for the burpees that we were in and in a plank position whoo,1
it's tough enough,1
his question is how can you get this playlist,1
i have designed this workout to be enjoyed,1
i know a lot of you guys are working out at home right now and a lot of you guys are working out in apartment buildings with downstairs neighbors so this is a really great workout for you so you don't disturb those neighbors or if you have a sleeping baby in the next room,1
there's always a body project you can punch anyone you like,1
i've been wanting to do that for years and g right,1

i'll be honest,1
i am so dripping,1
i love getting all the nutritious benefits in one pill you,1
so that's why i love the strength train,1
i'll be honest,1
kirstey just released an awesome strengthen hit program that just came out,1
i'm used to going to the gym and lifting heavy things but what i've been loving is changing the tempos going faster on some reps maybe slowing down some things some of the movements that i'm so used to picking up heavy weight,1
i don't envy her one little bit,1
and what i have had to really think about this time is changing things and looking at everything as an opportunity you know,1
copeland is back with us,1
so if you have any questions for me we're gonna answer them at the end of the chat cooldown,1
i don't even know what day it is anymore,1

oh jake you've earned those waffles after this workout,1
so thank you for that,1
firing my wife's guns okay,1

i take a befit multivitamin which not only keeps me healthy and strong but also boost my metabolism,1
plus plan takes us further than the real start planned,1
food and yeah,1
thank you so much for being here,1

[music] it's the new 20 21 28 day challenge and we've got a full body hit workout today to get you sweaty,1
feel the energy from these guys,1
chrissy how you feelin,1
if you want to waddle over to your computer and ask you a question type it up,1
wade loving that bud,1
we can keep that mahalo in our body,1
our girls tracey,1
it can be hard to get all the vitamins and minerals one needs from food alone,1
how well did these guys do,1
we've got hamstring punches now so the opposite hamstring,2
stay with me up,2
good back is nice and flat last one back to the middle good set your weights down because we have our first cardio move arms come up nice,2
you ready join me now,2
we've got in and out squat necks while working your core your thighs and your booty here,2
in three two one squat jumps or speed jumps,2
is it right here,2
deep breaths deep breaths feeling good,2
it's time for our finisher,2
don't save anything,2
start with your best gas,2
we're going hip switches,2
let's go almost there,2
peel yourself up and off the ground with the shoulders long down your back so really try to actively push in the ground,2
all you need is yourself a mat if you have one of course some water because we're really gonna get after it today we're gonna start off,2
don't be afraid to pick up heavier weight,2
so we're gonna go slow slow slow and then drive it up,2
keep your core and glutes engaged as you squat and reach your hands to the floor,2
[music] all right,2
[music] all right,2
your feet are the more stability you have switch,2
join me if you haven't already use your hands on the ground to give you some stability give you a little leverage because you want to keep the hips nice and stable as you're moving through these and really thinking about keeping the ribcage down and the tailbone tucked up so breathe,2
you ready for those burpees here,2
we're winning this is the halfway mark three two one here,2
but it's important to show you some different variations working through remember,2
shorten that lever or you can even bring the legs up a little bit higher but whatever you're doing try to keep that hollow in your belly keep a lot of tension shoulder blades off the ground,2
remember focus on your goals focus on what brought you here,2
you can always do any of these exercises slower adjusted based on,2
good hop hop squeeze good big exhale yep this is a cardio move so right now is when you're gonna start to probably break a sweat if you haven't already good ha ha down ha ha down two more last one beautiful all right quick,2
show me that game freak,2
you can bend those knees a little bit for a little more space big reach up take it back down,2
it's intense so that's what we're doing,2
alright we're gonna go for five more ready five four three,2
let's stay low,2
then we'll hinge and then bring it back up so i want you to feel the difference between these two movements with that squat you're bending those knees feeling it more in those quads and that hinge you should feel in the back of those legs so sit it back hinge it forward huh,2
it's a little easier standing a little harder standing it forces me to use a little bit more stability and a little bit more core but overall very comparable movements,2
this is different brady,2
we've got two more just like that,2
you ready join me now,2
here use that oblique as its left leg,2
fortunately we've got a little bit of time off cardio now,2
it means we're going to the ground,2
you're doing a row you want to be like you have a string attached to your elbows and you're just pulling back on it,2
you're with me,2
[music] nice all right next up returning to a plan,2
you should feel it more in that front leg but you definitely will feel it a little bit in that back especially in that hip flexor so keep it straight keep it forward,2
she's just using her body weight,2
doesn't matter either one whichever one you're doing still stays tight nice work,2
we are only moving through two different movement patterns,2
keep working keep going,2
let's start with knee,2
here we go up,2
you ready join me now and three two one take it down for four three two one reset bring it up down four three two one reset,2
let's go nice work,2
you can rest that knee or extend big reach up,2
we're gonna work the triceps,2
you're gonna kick it back and switch sides other side good,2
little dip and breathe the real star,2
keep that tailbone tucked,2
some shoulder taps and then repeat work your upper body guys and this is an easy one so keep going you can do it jungle of love,2
it's facing the front wall here,2
come on stay focused stay engaged,2
okay now we're going into a narrow and wide push-up so everything stays here,2
this is round one of three,2
keep working on,2
you can take a break whenever you need to,2
gotta stick that landing last one all right,2
yup come on,2
nice and slow,2
pause buttons there those buttons your friend whenever you need to use it,2
come on,2
stand it up shake it off you are done with that circuit,2
the physical body can do so much,2
we'll go two more each side,2
everything's going three more come on back,2
yeah okay so with these,2
you writing them right down the pipe three two one,2
join me now,2
switch yeah come on switch switch switch come on come on stay with me,2
come on two one reset last one,2
you got this come on driving through curl those pinkies in shoulders are back nice,2
wait behind your head,2
you're stronger than anything you can do this,2
except angie me always that's off-limits as much as you might want to three two and one march it out,2
we're winners,2
it feels awkward with shoulders,2
you're doing well,2
we're gonna come lie on one side we're gonna do one side for 45 seconds,2
i'm gonna grab my box over here,2
breathe get that energy back in focus with crisp movements good form,2
now i want you to try to extend the opposite leg when you're here,2
take those feet more narrow what you got look past those fingertips squeeze squeeze so heart rates,2
stand it up tap it out so we're not done yet,2
yeah let's get stretched off,2
come on but we do this together,2
hold but this time,2
correct on swing off of this,2
i'm so hot,2
what motivates you and get there,2
if you were doing low impact before you can spice it up by lifting your hands upwards like so [music] people say i try too hard,2
we're doing this two times,2
nice chandler perfect when the knees,2
let's get it side,2
but this time we're gonna change it up a little bit if you feel pretty good on these,2
and as long as you're here stretching with us whether you press pause 20 times whether you did half of each section or 10 percent of each section it doesn't matter because you can come back tomorrow and do a little bit more if you marched through the whole session,2
squeeze those quads push energy through your heels happy thoughts,2
drop it down squad,2
we're only going to bend at those elbows not moving the whole arm,2
now jump up from the floor bring your feet together or crisscross then jump back out into another squat and repeat if your hands can't touch the floor,2
big inhale and you are done you guys crush that every time you come into that room you get stronger you get better,2
so this is one of two finishers you ready to join me,2
be strong,2
let's get right into it,2
let's go come on,2
we're taking it into a squat so sitting back driving the knees out,2
come on two and one and we're straight in punches,2
come on you've got this,2
see the finish line,2
take a sip of water if you need it but these are quick,2
drive off those heels,2
join me come on,2
few more two one,2
that is what i call a kick off workout,2
now let's do it,2
don't quit now,2
good exactly i want a big exhale michelle,2
let's get it whoo,2
so you gotta keep going mom come on 10 more seconds,2
you're breaking glass and you might notice one sides a little bit harder than the other and that's totally fine,2
everything nice and strong,2
keep bringing those feet up [music] [music] that [music] all right front legs down on your back,2
keep them nice and stable,2
you've got this guys,2
because i want to keep the energy high and i've got a little treat for you,2
you're gonna do a donkey to pulse and extend diagonally,2
i'll give you one version for the first round and then each round i'll add on a little progression so first up we're gonna bring those shoulder blades off the ground,2
your legs are gonna feel like they're gonna fall but i promise they're gonna be there the whole time,2
the next move is a lateral lunge with the row,2
rage lunge solar rays lunge,2
we'll kind of stick that landing whoo yep slow slow slow control it,2
big inhale big exhale team,2
okay now we go little plank rows now i want you to row fast,2
let's get it,2
all right you can tell you rest,2
press off the heel and switch sides all right you ready michelle all right knee in line with that heel lunge and back to the center,2
come on come on three two one relax all right,2
it's okay take your rest and get back on it,2
don't bounce off the ground stay under control you got it nice work nice work,2
i want you to be your best,2
walk it out high plank,2
come on wait all the way now,2
if you have one big reach up nice and high bend those knees and walk it out into a high plank position rock forward and back maybe on those wrists a little bit maybe side to side and then walk your hands back,2
you're gonna do it a sumo pulse,2
stick that booty out and chest up,2
use that breath good,2
nice work reaching up,2
we're getting close to the end,2
it requires a bit of coordination,2
use that towel if you need to good work,2
good get that breath going,2
let's get to it all right guys our first move and work that supporting leg a little bit more toward your funny [music] all right 15 second rest in between this exercise or coming down my next exercise in double-figures come up in a reverse bridge position touch the knee reach for the toe toe reaching for the toes too much,2
you're with me,2
we got 10 more seconds on this one beyond those abs start to work,2
bring one leg to the side,2
we're on to our feet for the next one need both weights again,2
we're going back to the ground our push-ups we're changing it up now we're going into a staggered stance so we're gonna bring one arm down by our armpit and one arm by our head so we're gonna go here and then we'll switch join me now,2
let's do it all right,2
come on ten seconds nice and wide nice and narrow five come on four three two one,2
perfect we want to alternate keeping those elbows in by your side perfect,2
so we're lowering down at my count then driving through the heel keeping the feet right where they are,2
so we're going to turn our hips back so it's like a little fancy dance,2
that's right we always stick it out right,2
so guess what,2
i'm gonna take a little breather - it's ok,2
come on all the way out all the way out the enemy's come in three two one,2
all right,2
we're going narrow squat to wide so feet go more narrow than those hips sit in and then more of a sumo and out join me now,2
good five four,2
you decide which one is right for you if you don't feel comfortable the overhead quite yet grab a seat full range of motion on this one all the way up all the way down,2
we're gonna slow it down here a little bit opposite arm opposite leg,2
mm-hmm you got it,2
how can you go forward forward forward,2
not the one that you're raising right,2
alright let's switch it up,2
that's what matters that's what counts,2
you are gonna grab those dumbbells again for this now,2
try your best not to hyperextend your back to just come up until your upper body is in this nice straight line and make sure not to bounce your arms off the ground either nice work breathe one right into the next moving at a pace that you feel comfortable with you got it almost there,2
it is flowing through your body and changing your body,2
it's okay especially if you're not used to doing balance work,2
so we're getting your hamstrings your glutes your lower back,2
guys great job,2
already we're gonna start with a 22nd march,2
maybe just a little bit lower really depends on your flexibility and what feels comfortable,2
let's go hut switch,2
nice big strong kick instead of a go down okay,2
my knees out as i sit back chest is up,2
both of them are good,2
we'll drive through the heel bring it back together,2
i want it to go up as fast as you can,2
move so you switch nice and so when i say switch you move those hips one direction,2
come on we can ha we will,2
i kind of made comes with a little white light getting you in cama cama,2
let's go press those knuckles back towards the seat back towards the back of the room,2
if you're doing your shoulder press say get seated feel free to grab it otherwise kicking them up getting right into it bring those dumbbells down to about in line with your ears,2
all the way up all the way down and i'm just touching the chair and coming right back up,2
we got to put it in personal best personal best effort,2
nice work guys come on keep it up one into the next this,2
that doesn't give you much time,2
step your arms just in front of you,2
we're getting close tap those feet out now,2
i'm glad you think that way,2
we're gonna go over to the other side in three two one here,2
and bring her hands just below our knees and then repeat that same shrug,2
bring it to the side kick with your left back to center step with your left pick with your right back,2
come on angie come on all the way out now all the way out look at that speed and power that's drive that's the termination - game faces come on god,2
we're gonna count on our bellies next up,2
come on almost there up,2
the bad news is we've got some more tough work on the legs with some sidestep resistance in three two and one let's step it out now,2
work one right into the next good form not swinging the weights not getting a bunch of momentum involved almost there go five more seconds,2
we're gonna go to a nice little core set to start we're gonna hit three different moves and we're going three times through,2
knee comes up big exhale each time,2
quick feet with those hips switches,2
