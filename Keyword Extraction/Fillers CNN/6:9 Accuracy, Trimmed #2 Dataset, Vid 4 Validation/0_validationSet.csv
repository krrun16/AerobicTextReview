i really want to embrace being who i am and where i came from and i was actually born in the philippines and i came to the us when i was only 2 years old so obviously didn't remember the philippines very much and i went for christmas with my mom this past year for the first time and it was just so amazing to be able to get cultural touch with my culture but for me it's just really representing and being proud of everything that i do and always remembering where it came from because you know my mom is such a big representation of all of my hard work and she's taught me everything and i really think it's because we came from the philippines and i just like to be really proud of everything and i love filipino,1
so that's why i love the strength train,1

big inhale big exhale,2
we're going to get right back into it all right so we got ten seconds,2
go with the forward lunge chop it to the side,2
you're not just moving through the motions,2
all right,2
you want to keep the form,2
change your body change your life,2
now we're going back to our strength section,2
you can pump the march for the good breathe breathe in three two one remember,2
i know you can see it but i can right,2
crunch for one whole minute squat down and do a twister punch as you get up,2
you're gonna hold it in a squat just like this,2
keeping those elbows tucked in nice and tight to the body pulling back we're keeping our core tight and straight and our upper body is on a 45 degree angle,2
100 reps in this 30-second time period,2
so hovering off the ground tap and tap so balance something on your hips,2
we're gonna speed it up a little bit,2
we're going to start with a warm-up we're going to go into a wide squat squat right here feet back in the center and then one to the other side good,2
no swinging no swinging because now all of a sudden all the other muscles are taking over we just want to isolate the triceps on this one you got it ten more seconds,2
yeah side side side and relax alright team,2
then you need to up the weight nice okay not much time left on this one and five four three two and one nice all right,2
let's work three two one stars,2
nice chandler perfect when the knees,2
remember you can just speed it up or you could give me two at each one going fast,2
what are you saving it for,2
other side three two one here we go so i like a little arm movement,2
nice and straight on this movement so we're not breaking that straight line and hunching over but keeping our back straight while we're kicking those hips back,2
remember you don't have to listen to that,2
nice and strong so nice active shoulders,2
we go three two one,2
yes we're focusing on our legs but you still want to think about those back muscles to keep that nice strong posture,2
but before that we're gonna work for 20 seconds in a squat in a speed squat or a squat,2
let's get right into it,2
all that took was a short amount of time to break that sweat,2
come on come on,2
3 2 & 1,2
we're gonna work the triceps,2
we're on to our feet for the next one need both weights again,2
let's do this as fast as you can,2
it hurts,2
i am nice and sweaty,2
this is tough stuff,2
if you are using a weight that you can just do,2
she's going to be using one dumbbell,2
quick feet with those hips switches,2
this workout is a chair or a box for some of the modified movements,2
we're going narrow squat to wide so feet go more narrow than those hips sit in and then more of a sumo and out join me now,2
yes it burns yes but there,2
not the one that you're raising right,2
nice come on forward good so nice and quick forward yes you got it forward,2
bring the arms all the way up,2
and then shrug bringing your shoulders up to your ears,2
alright come on three two one,2
let's do some squats,2
big inhale big exhale get that blood moving flowin wakin up that body perfect nice and easy light on those toes,2
the bad news is we've got some more tough work on the legs with some sidestep resistance in three two and one let's step it out now,2
and i'm going to do this one from a standing position so from the box,2
we do it our way hands out in front core tight and we open up,2
use that breath good,2
two one touching touching knee opposite knee now feeling it working through,2
extend that leg back if you feel comfortable or you can keep it on the ground,2
okay so we're going to start with the march we're gonna pick it up three two one core tight 20 seconds and we're gonna move straight into that hooking knee breathe breathe breathe,2
we'll switch sides so go in a tempo that feels good for you so notice my front toe or my back,2
you should feel it more in that front leg but you definitely will feel it a little bit in that back especially in that hip flexor so keep it straight keep it forward,2
come on,2
if you feel really good we're going to hollow rocks join me here,2
we go pull lower down four three two one switch lower down four three two one switch so nice and slow,2
set that weight down,2
