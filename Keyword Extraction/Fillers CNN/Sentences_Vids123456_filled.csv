hey everybody it's your personal trainer,1,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
coach kozak here from hasfit.,1,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
and i'm claudia,1,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
and this is our beginner weight training routine,1,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
this routine is great for both men and women of a beginner fitness level,1,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
the only equipment required for this workout is a pair of dumbbells now,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
that weight of the dumbbells is going to be totally determined by your current fitness level,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
just remember it's much better to start light and work your way up than the other way around the only other equipment that you may want for,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
this workout is a chair or a box for some of the modified movements,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
we're going to do the whole thing with you,1,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
ready to get this thing,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
going all right we're going to start with either a dumbbell crusher or a dumbbell t-row so if you want to do the easier modified versions you go and follow claudia,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
she's going to be using one dumbbell,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
i'm going to use two,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
so that's the main difference,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
i'm going to squeeze these together and i'm going to pull back and claudia is just going to interlock her fingers and pull back either way,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
we're both pulling back on our elbows,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
keeping those elbows tucked in nice and tight to the body pulling back we're keeping our core tight and straight and our upper body is on a 45 degree angle,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
now we're not going to count any repetitions today,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
i just want you to try to perform as many moves as you can in allotted time period work at your own pace but at the same time be sure to push yourself because nobody else can do it for you,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
breathe nice work keep it going pulling back on those elbows keeping them tight to your body in five four three two and one okay,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
we're going to go to the ground for the next one,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
it's going to be a combo movement,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
we're going to need both weights for this one,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
we're going to do a hip up plus chest press,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
we're going to drive off our heels and at the same time we're going to press the dumbbell straight up and back down getting a lot of different body parts worked in this one,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
so we're getting your hamstrings your glutes your lower back your abs chest shoulders triceps,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
the list goes on but it's a very efficient movement getting a lot of work in in a short period of time,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
drive off those heels,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
squeeze the gluts up at the top,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
try your best not to hyperextend your back to just come up until your upper body is in this nice straight line and make sure not to bounce your arms off the ground either nice work breathe one right into the next moving at a pace that you feel comfortable with you got it almost there,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
let's go five more seconds on this one and four three two one and done okay,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
we're on to our feet for the next one need both weights again,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
we're going to either do a stiff leg,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
deadlift plus shrug or claudia is going to show you an rdl which stands for romanian deadlift,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
i didn't make that up,1,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
plus shrug either way,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
we're going to put our weight back in our hips little,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
bend the knee,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
i'm going to go all the way down,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
and i'm going to bring my hips forward and shrug claudia's just going to come,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
and bring her hands just below her knees and then repeat that same shrug,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
so we're driving our hips backwards,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
all the way up hips forward,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
and then shrug bringing your shoulders up to your ears,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
feel that stretch in your hamstrings,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
if you're not feeling a stretch in the back of your leg then i want to make sure you are driving those hips back,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
just a little bend in those knees and hips go back again,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
another combo movement this one we are getting hamstrings glutes lower back and your traps good and notice how both of us are keeping our backs,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
nice and straight on this movement so we're not breaking that straight line and hunching over but keeping our back straight while we're kicking those hips back,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
you got it almost done with this one,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
five four three two and last one zero nice,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
okay so we're going to move on to some shoulder presses next i'm gonna grab my box over here,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
claudia's going to grab her box,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
and i'm going to do this one from a standing position so from the box,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
it's a little easier standing a little harder standing it forces me to use a little bit more stability and a little bit more core but overall very comparable movements,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
you decide which one is right for you if you don't feel comfortable the overhead quite yet grab a seat full range of motion on this one all the way up all the way down,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
stay nice and under control you don't want to fling or swing the dumbbells around keep your core tight,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
this is a strength training routine so we don't want to,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
i know you said work at your own pace but we definitely don't want to make this a cardio and just start pumping out correct exactly reps,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
if you are using a weight that you can just do,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
100 reps in this 30-second time period,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
then you need to up the weight nice okay not much time left on this one and five four three two and one nice all right,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
shake those arms move this out of the way and we're going to move into a dumbbell curl so we're gonna hit those biceps next working on the gun show claudia's got a gun show with her tank top on tonight,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
look at those guns anyway just admiring my wife's guns okay,1,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
so we're going to do a curl,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
both palms come up,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
we're going to curl those pinkies in on the way up and then all the way back down again,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
this one's under control,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
so that means we're not swinging up and flinging them back down right that defeats the purpose,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
but instead i feel that time under tension feel those muscles contracting all the way up and all the way down you got it,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
good claudia's going to give you a nice side view,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
keep those shoulders back and square,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
mm-hmm you got it,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
we're breathing just 10 more seconds left on this one fight through you got it and three two one and zero alright,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
moving to the lower body,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
claudia is going to grab her box or if you have a chair that works as well if you want to do the modified version,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
i'm also going to lose a dumbbell here,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
yeah exactly she's only gonna use one weight good point so she's going to do a goblet squat,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
you notice how she's holding the weight up with two hands and i got a my thumbs out,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
i'm gonna do a dumbbell squat just at my side so i'm going to be able to get a little bit deeper than doing the chair or box squat but either way,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
we're both bending at the hips first driving those hips back and then coming down until our hips are parallel to the ground,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
all the way up all the way down and i'm just touching the chair and coming right back up,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
i'm not sitting not resting exactly or bouncing,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
that's the other thing right correct,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
i'll give you guys a side view here squatting make sure you keep those knees out,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
don't allow them to break or compress in nice work not much left on this one,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
i know your legs are probably starting to feel it,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
i didn't forget about you,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
we got five four three two and one done okay,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
we're going to move on,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
to a dumbbell tricep kickback,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
we're gonna hit those triceps next save movement really just to mix up your weight find,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
what weight works for you on this one,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
so we're bent over our elbows are up,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
we're only going to bend at those elbows not moving the whole arm,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
keep your core tight and at the top,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
you're squeezing that back of the arm squeezing your triceps up at the top nice work notice,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
we're using that elbow as a lever,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
so we're not moving that upper arm,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
just bend at the elbow,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
so what i mean by that is,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
you're not going here right,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
no swinging no swinging because now all of a sudden all the other muscles are taking over we just want to isolate the triceps on this one you got it ten more seconds,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
that's it guys are doing great,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
thank you so much for joining us today and for all of your hard work and three two one and done,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
okay we're going to the ground losing my weights claudia's going to lose her weights,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
i'm going to keep mine though we're going to do a dumbbell reach crunch so from a crunch position we're going to our feet on the ground,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
we're going to reach up to the ceiling,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
we're bringing our shoulder blades,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
off the ground and come back down so we are contracting the abs up at the top reaching up big and high you see i'm using my weights making it more difficult claudia,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
she's just using her body weight,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
you could also just use one weight if you wanted to,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
that's right so again it's all about making this your own coming back repeating it getting a little bit better every single time and that's how we improve that consistency,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
nice work reaching up,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
don't bounce off the ground stay under control you got it nice work nice work,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
we got 10 more seconds on this one feeling,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
those abs start to work,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
that's a good thing,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
that's the feeling of improvement right there and three two one and zero okay,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
we're going to rest,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
that's the end of the first round,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
we got one more to go all right so it's a quick 20 second break,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
that doesn't give you much time,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
if you want,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
feel free to grab some water shake it loose,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
take a couple deep breaths,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
we're going to get right back into it all right so we got ten seconds,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
i'm going to grab my dumbbells,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
we're getting ready,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
we're starting with the row,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
we're gonna i'm doing my crusher row claudia's doing her t row and here we go,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
we're pulling back at those elbows keeping our core nice and tight and if you're wondering why we didn't take a longer break even though we're beginners that's because the workout specifically designed to allow some muscles to rest while others are working so right now our backs working but at the same time our chest may be resting allows us to get a lot done in a short period of time again pulling back on those elbows anytime,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
you're doing a row,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
you want it to be like you have a string attached to your elbows and you're just pulling back on it,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
just be sure to keep that core tight also exactly,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
you don't want your back getting loose or allowing your abs to relax almost there on this one,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
let's go five four three two and one all right going to the ground you need both weights for this next one doing that,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
hip up plus chest press,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
so we're driving off the heels and squeezing our glutes and pressing up at the same time nice work and again on any of these,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
don't feel like you have to use the same weight for all of them,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
feel free to adjust the weight as you go through it,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
start with your best guesss,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
but don't just keep the weight if you're not able to complete the reps in a safe manner or the other way if it's not challenging you make sure to up the weight so you can get that full benefit nice work driving off the heels pressing straight up keep it up guys almost there and five four three two one zero,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
we're up on our feet and try to keep the pace up a little bit faster for the second round because we know what we're doing we're going to stiff leg deadlift or rdl plus shrug kick back right below your knees,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
pop em and shrug taking the weight back on our hips feeling that stretch and up and shrug nice work,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
this one really hits that whole posterior chain so important,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
i always say in your front are the show muscles in the back,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
are the go muscles basically means all your power and real athleticism comes from your backside,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
come on keep it up you got it nice work not many left,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
let's go five more seconds,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
that's it and four three two one and zero finishing strong,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
okay grab your seat if you got one so if you're doing your shoulder press seated feel free to grab it otherwise kicking them up getting right into it bring those dumbbells down to about in line with your ears,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
maybe just a little bit lower really depends on your flexibility and what feels comfortable,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
don't take it to a place,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
it feels awkward with your shoulders,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
nice work core stays tight,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
doesn't matter either one whichever one you're doing still stays tight nice work,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
this is about that point in the workout,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
where you start to really feel it it starts to kick in and it becomes all mental right now not even physical,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
it's all up in your head,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
it's all that mental toughness and grip that's going to keep you moving and fighting through rep by rep,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
let's go come on and five four three two one zero,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
ahh all right feeling good moving on to a dumbbell curl so we're hitting the biceps next,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
let's get it both curling at the same time curling those pinkies in there we go arms are starting to get a little bit of lactic,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
acid built up in them,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
remember you don't have to listen to that,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
that's just a pain signal but the muscles got plenty left,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
you got this come on driving through curl those pinkies in shoulders are back nice,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
work one right into the next using good form not swinging the weights not getting a bunch of momentum involved almost there let's go five more seconds that's it and four three two one zero all right all right,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
we're moving on to either a dumbbell squat or a dumbbell goblet squat from the chair,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
i'll clean that name up later,1,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
okay so we're going into our squats weights back on our hips making sure to break at the hips every time,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
because if you don't what happens is you bend at the knees first and you end up here,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
and then you're like oh man,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
my knees hurt hips back then squat,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
that's the key,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
keep those feet flat drive off the heels nice work,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
you got it every squat you do,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt
you're going to get that much better at it,2,Video_1_Hasfit.txt

drive those knees out go at your tempo so this week we've been thinking about new perspectives,2,Video_2_nikeTrainerClub.txt
and what i have had to really think about this time is changing things and looking at everything as an opportunity you know,1,Video_2_nikeTrainerClub.txt
i'm used to going to the gym and lifting heavy things but what i've been loving is changing the tempos going faster on some reps maybe slowing down some things some of the movements that i'm so used to picking up heavy weight,1,Video_2_nikeTrainerClub.txt
i just use my body and challenge myself in such a different way and i look at it as a brand new opportunity,1,Video_2_nikeTrainerClub.txt
so that's my new perspective for this week and for the past few months last one,1,Video_2_nikeTrainerClub.txt
