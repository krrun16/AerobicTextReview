if you'd like to take part in the rest of the real start plus plan with myself angie and wade come and join us at teen body project.com,1
she specifically went to her studio where she does her ceramics so she had a little bit of space to work out,1
come on you're why i work hard,1

how fun is it that we get to work out together,1

how are you going,1
i really want to embrace being who i am and where i came from and i was actually born in the philippines and i came to the us when i was only 2 years old so obviously didn't remember the philippines very much and i went for christmas with my mom this past year for the first time and it was just so amazing to be able to get cultural touch with my culture but for me it's just really representing and being proud of everything that i do and always remembering where it came from because you know my mom is such a big representation of all of my hard work and she's taught me everything and i really think it's because we came from the philippines and i just like to be really proud of everything and i love filipino,1

when i was able to see how much stronger my body could be it was such a good reminder anytime anything was challenging for myself i could remember how i was able to take control and to make myself better and make myself stronger,1
i'm used to going to the gym and lifting heavy things but what i've been loving is changing the tempos going faster on some reps maybe slowing down some things some of the movements that i'm so used to picking up heavy weight,1

oh okay stand up now,2
we're getting ready,2
let's place both hands on the ground,2
nice and warm,2
keep your core tight and at the top,2
we're done with our little strength set,2
i have a quick 10 minute workout for you,2
okay so now we're going into a plank row with a hold so when i say you're gonna pull and hold and then you'll switch when i say drive those elbows back and hold,2
you're feeling warm,2
bring it up to a point,2
press it back good chest up all the way down up squeeze now we know the moves so we can get into it down up,2
yeah let's get two more just like that down four three two one up last one,2
two one let's get three more just like that,2
you're stepping back as you step back,2
stick it hinge,2
if you didn't bring those hands up maybe try it this time ready,2
let's get that core tight power feeling that,2
we're going to get right back into it all right so we got ten seconds,2
don't worry if it takes you a second to get it,2
four three two one,2
stand it up tap it out so we're not done yet,2
we go to the other side and don't forget we have more of these workouts available on the ntc app and ntc premium is free in the us right now has amazing programs in there,2
you're stronger than the pain,2
we're going back to the upper body,2
let's try it chest up on this as we squat good elbows in by your side,2
good bring it in bring it in nice and tight,2
i gotta keep going core strong desire,2
are you moving,2
you should feel it more in that front leg but you definitely will feel it a little bit in that back especially in that hip flexor so keep it straight keep it forward,2
yeah it's okay just focus on you're slowing down your breath but next around what we do these,2
we have one more time through after this four three two one recover all right,2
we've got two more just like that,2
i want you to pretend like the groud’s hot,2
three two one,2
one straight supporting leg flat back back to the middle good lunge row down but let's pick up that pace okay,2
i'm gonna do a dumbbell squat just at my side so i'm going to be able to get a little bit deeper than doing the chair or box squat but either way,2
this workout is a chair or a box for some of the modified movements,2
that's what it's all about,2
we are almost there,2
keep working keep going dig dig dig,2
yes we're focusing on our legs but you still want to think about those back muscles to keep that nice strong posture,2
relax go and slow those hips down,2
lower is not necessarily better on these,2
you got this come on driving through curl those pinkies in shoulders are back nice,2
that's right we always stick it out right,2
good get that breath going,2
seconds keep your bodies moving and 20 seconds of your choice of stars,2
use that breath good,2
i'm going to go all the way down,2
go ahead back to the middle again side,2
ah breathe it through work,2
we're going one more time on those hinges,2
walk it in and up,2
you can pump the march for the good breathe breathe in three two one remember,2
core tight and we'll only have a couple of more seconds to go,2
keep the hip as level as you,2
slow and steady,2
bring one leg to the side and lash down then climb back up to the center and jump up below impact just two-letter lunch only without the jump,2
you're already a little bit upset with us for the speed and the intensity but this is about taking your body on that bit further,2
we've got this,2
it's a little easier standing a little harder standing it forces me to use a little bit more stability and a little bit more core but overall very comparable movements,2
come on come on come on big effort big effort that pain,2
make sure you're breathing,2
that's the end of the first round,2
and i almost lost my bearings,2
we're starting with the row,2
show me show me come on,2
stay with me here,2
my team kicks booty flat back,2
we're doing a jumping jack and then crunching bringing the opposite elbow to me out and in those arms nice and strong good all right next up four punches one,2
i'm going to grab my dumbbells,2
then we'll hinge and then bring it back up so i want you to feel the difference between these two movements with that squat you're bending those knees feeling it more in those quads and that hinge you should feel in the back of those legs so sit it back hinge it forward huh,2
we're going to do a hip up plus chest press,2
the way that this workout is structured today is we are going to have three mini circuits within our 15 minute workout,2
i just want you to finish with us,2
we're gonna still break that glass,2
shake those arms move this out of the way and we're going to move into a dumbbell curl so we're gonna hit those biceps next working on the gun show claudia's got a gun show with her tank top on tonight,2
use your core to keep you strong,2
i just want you to try to perform as many moves as you can in allotted time period work at your own pace but at the same time be sure to push yourself because nobody else can do it for you,2
um don't forget you can have a bit of a hop in here,2
get your breath slowed down a little bit,2
drop it down squad,2
perfect we want to alternate keeping those elbows in by your side perfect,2
everything we do here we will start is one low-impact and two standing so you could be confident that you can be involved and work out the whole way through,2
this is real stuff,2
we go two one two and again one two we pause in the middle one two,2
come on two one,2
try your best not to hyperextend your back to just come up until your upper body is in this nice straight line and make sure not to bounce your arms off the ground either nice work breathe one right into the next moving at a pace that you feel comfortable with you got it almost there,2
we lift the left knee,2
that was fun,2
so we're not moving that upper arm,2
it's intense so that's what we're doing,2
then we're done so stay with me,2
nice chandler perfect when the knees,2
ahh we can see the finish line like thoroughbred horses,2
you can go fast,2
oblique crunch for another 30 seconds,2
come on great job,2
maybe you got a tuck jump burpee,2
that's where we succeed three two and one we march next up touching knee raises,2
gotta stick that landing last one all right,2
let's do this as fast as you can,2
we're winning this is the halfway mark three two one here,2
bring the arms all the way up,2
are the go muscles basically means all your power and real athleticism comes from your backside,2
try to control your breathing nice big inhales and big exhales,2
perfect one more each side back to the middle last one good work perfect all right move to,2
we're going to reach up to the ceiling,2
should we sand it off all right,2
remember this is your workout,2
we're going to need both weights for this one,2
we're pulling back at those elbows keeping our core nice and tight and if you're wondering why we didn't take a longer break even though we're beginners that's because the workout specifically designed to allow some muscles to rest while others are working so right now our backs working but at the same time our chest may be resting allows us to get a lot done in a short period of time again pulling back on those elbows anytime,2
feel that stretch see,2
yeah whoo keep it strong few more slow slow slow drive it up all right other side,2
muhammad ali,2
come on angie come on all the way out now all the way out look at that speed and power,2
that's it guys are doing great,2
if you feel good or you can just stay here,2
so you're doing one right and one left,2
so we're driving off the heels and squeezing our glutes and pressing up at the same time nice work and again on any of these,2
we're going to either do a stiff leg,2
we'll kind of stick that landing whoo yep slow slow slow control it,2
we got 10 more seconds on this one feeling,2
yeah there we go catch your breath now,2
yep everyone's doing great stay with me three two one,2
she's putting some punches in,2
you're gonna peel your hips off the ground and then you're gonna dig one heel to the ground as you bring one knee to your chest and then switch it out,2
good morning to you awesome job,2
come on come on,2
i'm so excited right now because the ground is hot you got to pick up your feet and then we're going to cool it down four high knees,2
i want it to go up as fast as you can,2
you've got that sidestep,2
so those excuses that you don't have time roll your wrists all the way down,2
we're gonna go through that a few times here so i have to give a shout-out to my girl so super sam for creating today's amazing playlist and she's also a fella filipina and we're celebrating asian pacific american heritage month here at nike so we got to represent the pinas,2
toe is in line with the back heel,2
come on but we do this together,2
jacks make,2
today it has four circuits two strength moves and one cardio move you guys ready to go,2
let's go and five four three two one and done okay,2
alright cardio move is gonna be hop hop reach down hop hop reach down you guys,2
it's 20 seconds of each of them back-to-back so 20 seconds of marching fast or running 20 seconds of punches and 20 seconds and ease and 20,2
so what i mean by that is,2
jump whatever you want to do and when i say hold we'll hold it low,2
keep that core tight,2
that's drive that's determination two game faces,2
that breath is gonna help with your movements,2
let's finish this workout,2
let's go few more seconds,2
then do another squat and repeat for low-impact,2
big reach try to reach to the ceiling,2
relax other side slight bend in the leg,2
it's the touch and knee raise coming to the left,2

come on let those legs burn right,2
use those arms,2
alright come on three two one,2
squeeze those quads push energy through your heels happy thoughts,2
use that towel,2
i hope you're still with me,2
we're moving on to either a dumbbell squat or a dumbbell goblet squat from the chair,2
take it back down,2
feel it in your ass exhale as you bring the knee in good,2
we want the back of the room,2
slight bend in the leg chest up,2

we are doing bicycles next,2
now we have double hop burpees starting high playing then jumbo feet in and out and eat again then get up and do another jump off the ground for low impact,2
let's get it whoo,2
that's how we feel,2
alright peel yourself up off the ground,2
how are you feeling everyone feeling good all right so we're moving into our strength set,2
let's start with butt kickers,2
this definitely works,2
i feel like a bit of a fibber feeling that adrenaline working through now though,2
that's it and four three two one and zero finishing strong,2
she's going to be using one dumbbell,2
we're here for it,2
how good do you feel having done that session today,2

you notice how she's holding the weight up with two hands and i got a my thumbs out,2
this is another gear yet,2
four three two one and reset okay,2
we've got hamstring punches now so the opposite hamstring,2
that is what i call an intense punching session deep breathes,2
thank you for pushing everyone around you so keep that back flat shoulders back,2
want that knee to stay in line with that heel so look down,2
there doesn't mean you have to do the whole thing,2
this is a strength training routine so we don't want to,2
good to reach arms toward the back,2
we're up on our feet and try to keep the pace up a little bit faster for the second round because we know what we're doing we're going to stiff leg deadlift or rdl plus shrug kick back right below your knees,2
