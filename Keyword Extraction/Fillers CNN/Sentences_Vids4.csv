so all you need today is yourself and a little bit of space around you,1
the way that this workout is structured today is we are going to have three mini circuits within our 15 minute workout,2

each and we're not going to be taking any rest at all during the next 15 minutes but i promise it's going to fly by you guys are really going to enjoy this one,2
make sure that you can see your screen so you can follow along with me and without further ado,2
let's get to it all right guys,2
we're starting off nice and simple just with a jog in place like so you can bring those feet up to kick your bum or you can just keep it nice and small keep that core nice and tight and keep those arms moving all right next up,2
we're just gonna do some marches in place so bringing those knees up nice and high keeping that core nice and tight arms moving if you want to increase the intensity a little bit you can add a bit of a hope hear me all right next up feet nice and wide touching opposite toe coming up for a job all right next up,2
