if this is too hot you can do a side plank hole now,2
let's start with butt kickers,2
keep that tailbone tucked,2
let's go stay with it desire drive,2
if you can't do a regular push-up you can start with just toe tap only that eventually,2
i'm going to go all the way down,2
you don't want your back getting loose or allowing your abs to relax almost there on this one,2
please press pause whenever you have to take an extra break whenever you need to and march and breathe,2
this time i'm going to say side and when i say side you're gonna jump to the side and bring it back to center but we're gonna all jump to your right you ready here,2
maybe just a little bit lower really depends on your flexibility and what feels comfortable,2
press it straight up and back down perfect so you got this loop,2
just be sure to keep that core tight also exactly,2
everyone stay strong with me,2
it starts with the next punch it starts with the next knee three two and one channeling it up now feeling it work big energy big drive big desire three two one come on,2
you've got that sidestep,2
squat low guys work those legs and back and also your abs now squat a little and take a little hop with one leg to the side for low impact,2
you got it good weight in the heels abs in tight,2
breathe control it so these metrics are so great because you can feel every single muscle in your body you can make sure you're doing the form right,2
i want to stay there,2
let's go down curl and press beautiful all right,2
moving to the lower body,2
okay so we're going to move on to some shoulder presses next i'm gonna grab my box over here,2
remember the lower,2
we're gonna start our stretch,2
we're gonna hit those triceps next save movement really just to mix up your weight find,2
let's get the hamstrings warm now,2
we're going to rest,2
come on two one,2
that's three two one all right last time on the bridge march,2
keep a nice and strong after this we have our bare plank and then we'll try to get the heart rate up a little bit more squad,2
let's do it lower and squeeze it up,2
and i almost lost my bearings,2
we're just gonna start to bounce side to side getting that heart rate up,2
going all right we're going to start with either a dumbbell crusher or a dumbbell t-row so if you want to do the easier modified versions you go and follow claudia,2
let's push come on,2
you can go slow or you can go fast,2
and i want these to be your best punches,2
don't save anything,2
but this time we're gonna change it up a little bit if you feel pretty good on these,2
just remember it's much better to start light and work your way up than the other way around the only other equipment that you may want for,2
i want it to go up as fast as you can,2
can you ready join me now,2
that's the key,2
just raise the knee up without the jump,2
lower those legs down,2
come on let's go,2
stick that booty out and chest up,2
the next move is a lateral lunge with the row,2
stand it up tap it out so we're not done yet,2
you're more than halfway there,2
i can't keep up with this,2
breathe remember this,2
and then everything stays wide arms close arms wide arms close arms wide,2

right here right now,2
this one's under control,2
row it back down,2
and let's get started,2
you're breaking glass and you might notice one sides a little bit harder than the other and that's totally fine,2
