it can be hard to get all the vitamins and minerals one needs from food alone,1
i really want to embrace being who i am and where i came from and i was actually born in the philippines and i came to the us when i was only 2 years old so obviously didn't remember the philippines very much and i went for christmas with my mom this past year for the first time and it was just so amazing to be able to get cultural touch with my culture but for me it's just really representing and being proud of everything that i do and always remembering where it came from because you know my mom is such a big representation of all of my hard work and she's taught me everything and i really think it's because we came from the philippines and i just like to be really proud of everything and i love filipino,1
