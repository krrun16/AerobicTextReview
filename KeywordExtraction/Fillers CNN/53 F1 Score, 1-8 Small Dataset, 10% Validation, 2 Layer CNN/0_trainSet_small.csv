i really want to embrace being who i am and where i came from and i was actually born in the philippines and i came to the us when i was only 2 years old so obviously didn't remember the philippines very much and i went for christmas with my mom this past year for the first time and it was just so amazing to be able to get cultural touch with my culture but for me it's just really representing and being proud of everything that i do and always remembering where it came from because you know my mom is such a big representation of all of my hard work and she's taught me everything and i really think it's because we came from the philippines and i just like to be really proud of everything and i love filipino,1

keep bringing those feet up [music] [music] that [music] all right front legs down on your back,2
give me one more chest up curl the dumbbells and press it up,2
remember the lower,2
we go get that core strong engage,2
three two one tap tap,2
side come on side,2
i mean it's not right there so we're getting there up next three,2
but don't just keep the weight if it's not if you're not able to complete the reps in a safe manner or the other way if it's not challenging you make sure to up the weight so you can get that full benefit nice work driving off the heels pressing straight up keep it up guys almost there and five four three two one zero,2
i don't know step it,2
you're not resting here you'll be hovering before you push back up so you should feel it in your thighs your upper body your glutes and your lower back try to use really smooth movements about 15 second flush right next up we have squats plus side lifts so then do a lift on each side in between their squat,2
just two more exercises to go guys take a big step or hop to the side then back to the middle then to the other side this can be difficult for those who don't have hip mobility,2
we're gonna work the triceps,2
change your body change your life,2
ten seconds left five seconds all right,2
we'll get two more just like that big reach up and then last one take it down,2
i'm gonna take a little breather - it's ok,2
keep working through almost halfway,2
good job we've got a few more just like that,2
but if you're feeling pretty good i want to see that glass break,2
you taught me everything,2
i have designed this workout to be enjoyed,2
keeping your heels hovered as we extend your arms up over the chest squeezing our body together option,2
you're straight so your posture is strong,2
but before that we're gonna work for 20 seconds in a squat in a speed squat or a squat,2
don't quit now,2
we're up on our feet and try to keep the pace up a little bit faster for the second round because we know what we're doing we're going to stiff leg deadlift or our dl+ shrug kick back,2
[music] [applause] [music] hollywood [music] step 2 is done pause,2
here we are here,2
if you find it hard to do cutscene lunges you can do reverse lunges somehow [music] that's how it goes when you hollywood perfect [music] nicely done we've got heinzmann next,2
give me that squat,2
second round of those sidestep jacks so,2
but this time we're gonna change it up a little bit if you feel pretty good on these,2
let's go you guys down down down,2
good one more each side and back to the mill,2
that's going to go right into ten reps of a forward arm circle bringing those arms out nice and wide,2
yeah build that tension through the ground few more here last one and one all right,2
don't worry if it takes you a second to get it,2
now how good do you feel having done that session today,2
no three jacks repeat this time leading with the different leg,2
your best effort is what i want to see,2
everything nice and strong,2
two one remember you do not have to touch the floor,2
the other day i've got about 20 seconds in with weights and i thought i'll give them to angie because i can do that,2
here we go up,2
you're feeling warm,2
yeah whoo keep it strong few more slow slow slow drive it up all right other side,2
i want you to squeeze your buns nice and tight abs in tight,2
come on come on anthony,2
let's go remember,2
the clock keeps ticking,2
stand it up tap it out so we're not done yet,2
let's go five more seconds on this one and four three two one and done okay,2
lift up i'm trying to make this as controlled as you can,2
we're go ahead turn to the side so you can see,2
use your core to keep you strong,2
today's workout's going to consist of six blocks including a warm-up and a flexibility block before we start each block,2
now's the time to pause,2
maybe just a little bit lower really depends on your flexibility and what feels comfortable,2
wade loving that bud,2
take a sip of water if you need it but these are quick,2
just some nice deep breaths here all right,2
this is round one of three,2
i'm gonna do a quick cool down so bring your feet apart,2
i know you're tired but i'm right here with you,2
lean forward as much as you need to you to get a good stretch right now tilt forward straight in here,2
so if that's the case you can try the low impact,2
i'm going to go all the way down,2
we're gonna count on our bellies next up,2
we're gonna start our stretch,2
extend that leg back if you feel comfortable or you can keep it on the ground,2
it's not gonna be dramatic,2
we're going low fast march,2
we're going to go back to those fast feet this time,2
keep your body as stiff as you can down four three push energy through your heels,2
three two one all right dig into the floor,2
let's go last four three two one woohoo all right bridge march now so again peeling the hips off the ground dig into the floor three two one,2
pull switch start by lifting your arms up one leg extended behind you,2
ahh all right feeling good moving on to a dumbbell curls,2
we know these hurts your mind ready,2
we got to go the other way on those switches so catch your breath my heart rates up,2
doesn't matter either one whichever one you're doing still stays tight nice work,2
so let's just get right into it,2
[music] [music] all right,2
we've got 20 total there 10 on each side last exercise ready to work that core a little bit more alright layin,2
hold come on switch drive those elbows back squeeze hold switch switch so the wider,2
and this sides a little wobbly for me all right last one drive it up,2
we're gonna come lie on one side we're gonna do one side for 45 seconds,2
all right flip over into the front position on your hands next up,2
i'm going to start with this leg,2
that's great never question yourself every moment that you move your body is a step towards the outcomes that you want,2
don't take it to a place,2
through rep by rep,2
all the way down on our back,2
if you want to step it up mm-hmm just add in some jumps,2
nice work not much left more than halfway done with this one already here,2
other side stagger the foot chest up,2
we stretch out the front of those thighs quadriceps,2
bend your knees until you can get to the floor,2
this might feel really new to you,2
[music] engage those abs as you bring the knee up [music] [music] [music] [music] so keep that foot parallel meaning the top of your foot,2
ready to get this thing,2
you're ready angie,2
as well for that warm-up two one here we go just side to side enjoy the easy stuff,2
then we're done so stay with me,2
it means we're going to the ground,2
we're going to do one light each for 45 seconds,2
get that scoop,2
your deep runners lunge go down as far as you need to to get a good stretch,2
health is in the mind more than in the body your strength and your character in your heart if you like in your spirit,2
just take a big step instead of hopping from side to side and also go slower,2
it defeats the purpose,2
yep everyone's doing great stay with me three two one,2
next up we have ten total reps of an alternating reverse lunge,2
keep that chest up,2
come on up,2
enjoy being with us,2
alright just kidding i want you to place your hands right underneath your shoulders,2
i just want you to finish with us,2
press into your supporting leg into that heel strong kicks few more seconds,2
that's halfway 10 seconds left 3 2 1 right next up we're doing the supine plank reach so this one's kind of fun we're gonna start on one side,2
yep so if you want to make it switch easier you could bring your feet wider switch or you can bring them more narrow to make it more challenging switch,2
you don't want your back getting loose or allowing your abs to relax almost there on this one,2
stay here for a couple breaths,2
let's do let's work,2
otherwise a good job,2
it's about doing it right,2
three two one rest,2
let's go to the side good,2
i don't really think it's fair to have the word just anywhere near this workout to be honest but it's there it's there loving the energy guys next up we've got oblique crunches it's gonna be - crunches on each side okay,2
both palms come up,2
we're actually switching out the last exercise which was obliques before,2
come on angie look at the speed ha work through now come on drive desire,2
you want to make sure you keep breathing,2
that's what they're there for [music] our next final exercise of the second set while shuffling to one side,2
good morning to you awesome job,2
row it back down,2
it's rising up three,2
all the way up hips forward,2
let's go 40 seconds,2
you're not working during push-up also,2
we've got three two one and recover all right we're going back to those hollow holds,2
come back down,2
i'm feeling the pain we're all there,2
nice work core stays tight,2
so guess what,2
slight bend in the leg chest up,2
press it up good,2
relax okay,2
you feel a good stretch right now,2
let's swing it on around alright so now we're going into those bare planks again,2
it's okay to do that while you're working out your option here,2
is it right here,2
we'll drive through the heel bring it back together,2
i know you said work at your own pace,2
that's okay do the best you can,2
ten seconds ah breathe,2
jump squeeze those glutes at the top and also squeeze your inner thighs together,2
because if you don't what happens is you bend at the knees first and you end up here,2
let's push,2
this kind of stuff makes it a lot,2
we've got a few more just like this squad so we will revisit this hinge later on in a single leg position whoo last one all right so warm up feeling good,2
come on work through,2
keep those feet flat drive off the heels nice work,2
we've got five exercises starting first d,2
but bring your back foot as close to your butt as possible,2
you can always do any of these exercises slower adjusted based on,2
we've got overhead to jumping jacks,2
we got,2
we're gonna walk our hands down into that high plank,2
step up your best best intervals,2
how you feeling wait,2
clean your feet,2
let's go ahead and take that foot outside of your hand,2
that's it guys are doing great,2
three two one,2
we're going to do someone like bridges,2
and we lost my bearings nice and strong core tight,2
squad don't drop early come on four three two slowly,2
oh i'm really sorry about this guy's we're doing it again so i'm changing the order,2
we're going to do a hip up plus chest press,2
that's a challenge,2
knee comes up big exhale each time,2
go through that finish line,2
i want to stay there,2
acid built up in them,2
we go so down,2
the list goes on but it's a very efficient movement getting a lot of work in in a short period of time,2
and then everything stays wide arms close arms wide arms close arms wide,2
i got for you and then boom,2
not perfection do your best march whenever you have to be strong three two and one and a nice march next one is a touch and me raise okay and we're gonna touch and raise into the right knee so fast pace keep marching,2
the back of your heels here,2
switch switch switch switch yes squad come on kersey you still with me,2
open your chest up a nice stretch going forward over this foot,2
let's get that explosive,2
[music] nice all right next up returning to a plan,2
you can bring your knee up from outer space,2
this is the last round,2
big inhale big exhale,2
if you want,2
i want you to take the elbow down and then open it up,2
