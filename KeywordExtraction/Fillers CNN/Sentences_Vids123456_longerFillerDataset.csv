hey everybody it's your personal trainer,1,HasFit
coach kozak here from has fake,1,HasFit
and i'm claudia,1,HasFit
and this is our beginner weight training routine,1,HasFit
this routine is great for both men and women of a beginner fitness level,1,HasFit
the only equipment required for this workout is a pair of dumbbells now,2,HasFit
that weight of the dumbbells is going to be totally determined by your current fitness level,2,HasFit
just remember it's much better to start light and work your way up than the other way around the only only other equipment that you may want for,2,HasFit
this workout is a chair or a box for some of the modified movements,2,HasFit
we're going to do the whole thing with you,2,HasFit
ready to get this thing,2,HasFit
going all right we're going to start with either a dumbbell crusher or a dumbbell tiro so if you want to do the easier modified versions you go and follow claudia,2,HasFit
she's going to be using one dumbbell,2,HasFit
i'm going to use two,2,HasFit
so that's the main difference,2,HasFit
i'm going to squeeze these together and i'm going to pull back and claudia is just going to interlock her fingers and pull back either way,2,HasFit
we're both pulling back on our elbows,2,HasFit
keeping those elbows tucked in nice and tight to the body pulling back we're keeping our core tight and straight and our upper body is on a 45 degree angle,2,HasFit
now we're not going to count any repetitions today,2,HasFit
i just want you to try to perform as many moves as you can in allotted time period work at your own pace but at the same time be sure to push yourself because nobody else can do it for you,2,HasFit
three nice work keep it going pulling back on those elbows keeping them tight to your body in five four three two and one okay,2,HasFit
we're going to go to the ground for the next one,2,HasFit
it's going to be a combo movement,2,HasFit
we're going to need both weights for this one,2,HasFit
we're going to do a hip up plus chest press,2,HasFit
we're going to drive off our heels and at the same time we're going to press the dumbbell straight up and back down getting a lot of different body parts worked in this one,2,HasFit
so we're getting your hamstrings your glutes your lower back,2,HasFit
your abs just shoulders triceps,2,HasFit
the list goes on but it's a very efficient movement getting a lot of work in in a short period of time,2,HasFit
drive off those heels,2,HasFit
squeeze the gluts up at the top,2,HasFit
try your best not to hyperextend your back to just come up until your upper body is in this nice straight line and make sure not to bounce your arms off the ground either nice work breathe one right into the next moving at a pace that you feel comfortable with you got it almost there,2,HasFit
let's go five more seconds on this one and four three two one and done okay,2,HasFit
we're on to our feet for the next one need both weights again,2,HasFit
we're going to either do a stiff leg,2,HasFit
deadlift plus shrug or claudia is going to show you an ar deal with chance for romanian deadlift,2,HasFit
i didn't make that up,1,HasFit
we're going to put our weight back in our hips little,2,HasFit
bend the knee,2,HasFit
i'm going to go all the way down,2,HasFit
and i'm going to bring my hips forward and shrug claudia's just going to come,2,HasFit
and bring her hands just below our knees and then repeat that same shrug,2,HasFit
so we're driving our hips backwards,2,HasFit
all the way up hips forward,2,HasFit
and then shrug bringing your shoulders up to your ears,2,HasFit
feel that stretching your hamstrings,2,HasFit
if you're not feeling a stretch in the back of your leg then i want to make sure you drive in those hips back just a little bit in those knees and hips,2,HasFit
go back again,2,HasFit
another combo movement this one feet in hamstrings gluts lower back and your traps good and notice how both of us are keeping our backs,2,HasFit
nice and straight on this movement so we're not breaking that straight line and punching over but keeping our back straight while we're kicking those hips back you got it almost done with this one five four three two and last one zero nice okay,2,HasFit
so we're going to move on to some shoulder presses next,2,HasFit
i'm gonna grab my box over here,2,HasFit
claudia's going to grab our box,2,HasFit
and i'm going to do this,2,HasFit
one from a standing position so from the box,2,HasFit
it's a little easier standing a little harder standing it forces me to use a little bit more stability and a little bit more core but overall very comparable movements,2,HasFit
you decide which one is right for you if you don't feel comfortable the overhead quite yet grab a seat full range of motion on this one all the way up all the way down,2,HasFit
stay nice and under control you want to fling or swing the dumbbells around keep your core tight,2,HasFit
this is a strength training routine so we don't want to,2,HasFit
i know you said work at your own pace,2,HasFit
but we definitely don't want to make this a cardio and just start pumping out correct exactly right if you using a weight that you can just do,2,HasFit
100 reps in this 30-second time period,2,HasFit
then you up the weight nice okay not much time left on this one and five four three two and one nice all right,2,HasFit
shake the arm,2,HasFit
move this out of the way and we're going to move into a dumbbell curl so we're gonna hit those biceps next working on the gun show chloe's got to go and show her tank top on tonight with those guns anyway,2,HasFit
firing my wife's guns okay,1,HasFit
so we're going to do a curl,2,HasFit
both palms come up,2,HasFit
we're going to curl those pinkies in on the way up and then all the way back down again,2,HasFit
this one's under control so that means we're not swinging up and flinging them back down right,2,HasFit
it defeats the purpose,2,HasFit
but instead i feel that time under tension feel those muscles contracting all the way up and all the way down you got it good closing give you a nice side view,2,HasFit
keep those shoulders back and square,2,HasFit
mm-hmm you got it,2,HasFit
we're breathing just 10 more seconds left on this one flight through you got it and three two one and zero are moving to the lower body,2,HasFit
claudia is going to grab her box or if you have a chair that works as well if you want to the modified version,2,HasFit
i'm also going to lose a dumbbell,2,HasFit
here yeah gigi exactly,1,HasFit
she's only gonna use one way good point so she's going to do a goblet squats,2,HasFit
she notice how she's holding the way up two hands and i got a new thumbs out,2,HasFit
i'm not gonna do a dumbbell squat just with at my side so i'm going to go up,2,HasFit
be able to get a little bit deeper,2,HasFit
then doing the chair or box squat,2,HasFit
but either way we're both bending at the hips first driving those hips back and then coming down until our hips are parallel to the ground,2,HasFit
all the way up all the way down and i'm just touching the chair and coming right back up,2,HasFit
i'm not sitting not resting exactly,2,HasFit
i make sure you're bouncing,2,HasFit
that's the other thing right,2,HasFit
correct on swing off of this,2,HasFit
if you guys still shave you hear the seat either or squatting make sure you keep those knees out,2,HasFit
don't allow them to break your compress in nice work,2,HasFit
how much left on this one,2,HasFit
i know your legs are probably starting to feel it,2,HasFit
i didn't forget about you,2,HasFit
we got five four three two and one done okay,2,HasFit
we're going to move on,2,HasFit
to a dumbbell tricep kickback,2,HasFit
we're gonna hit those triceps next save movement really just to put a mix up your weight find,2,HasFit
what weight works for you on this one,2,HasFit
so we're bent over our elbows are up,2,HasFit
we're only going to bend at those elbows not moving the whole arm,2,HasFit
keep your core tight and at the top,2,HasFit
you're squeezing that back of the arm squeezing your triceps up at the top nice work notice,2,HasFit
we're using that elbow as a lever,2,HasFit
so we're not moving that upper arm,2,HasFit
just bend at the elbow so i mean but as you're not going here right now singing no swinging because now all the sudden all the other muscles are taking over we just want to isolate the triceps on this one you got it ten more seconds,2,HasFit
that's it guys are doing great,2,HasFit
thank you so much for joining us today and for all of your hard work and three two one and done,2,HasFit
okay we're going to the ground losing my weights body's going to lose your weights,2,HasFit
i'm going to keep mine though we're going to do a dumbbell reach crunch so from a crunch position we're going to our feet on the ground,2,HasFit
we're going to reach up to the ceiling,2,HasFit
we're going our shoulder blades,2,HasFit
off the ground and come back down to earth contracting the abs up at the top reaching up big and high you see i'm using my weights making it more difficult claudia,2,HasFit
she's just using her body weight,2,HasFit
you could also just use one way if you wanted to straight so again,2,HasFit
it's all about making this your own coming back repeating it getting a little bit better every single time and that's how we improve that consistency,2,HasFit
nice work reaching up,2,HasFit
don't bounce off the ground stay under control you got it nice work nice work,2,HasFit
we got 10 more seconds on this one beyond those abs start to work,2,HasFit
that's a good thing,2,HasFit
that's the feeling of improvement right there and three two one and zero okay,2,HasFit
we're going to rest,2,HasFit
that's the end of the first round,2,HasFit
we got one more to go all right so it's a quick 20 second break,2,HasFit
that doesn't give you much time,2,HasFit
if you want,2,HasFit
feel free to grab some water shake it loose,2,HasFit
take a couple deep breaths,2,HasFit
we're going to get right back into it all right so we got ten seconds,2,HasFit
i'm going to grab my dumbbells,2,HasFit
we're getting ready,2,HasFit
we're starting with the row we're gonna doing my crusher row claudia's doing her t row and here we go,2,HasFit
we're pulling back at those elbows keeping our core nice and tight and if you're wondering why we didn't take a longer break even though we're beginners that's because the workout specifically designed to allow some muscles to rest while others are working so right now our backs working but at the same time our chest may be resting allows us to get a lot done in a short period of time again pulling back on those elbows anytime,2,HasFit
you're doing a row you want to be like you have a string attached to your elbows and you're just pulling back on it,2,HasFit
just be sure to keep that core tight also exactly,2,HasFit
you don't want your back getting loose or allowing your abs to relax almost there on this one,2,HasFit
let's go five four three two and one all right going to the ground you need both weights for this next one doing that,2,HasFit
hip up plus chest press,2,HasFit
so we're driving off the heels and squeezing our glutes and pressing up at the same time nice work and again on any of these,2,HasFit
don't feel like you have to use the same weight for all of them,2,HasFit
feel free to adjust the way as you go through it,2,HasFit
start with your best gas,2,HasFit
but don't just keep the weight if it's not if you're not able to complete the reps in a safe manner or the other way if it's not challenging you make sure to up the weight so you can get that full benefit nice work driving off the heels pressing straight up keep it up guys almost there and five four three two one zero,2,HasFit
we're up on our feet and try to keep the pace up a little bit faster for the second round because we know what we're doing we're going to stiff leg deadlift or our dl+ shrug kick back,2,HasFit
blow your knees hop in the truck taking the weight back on our hips feeling that stretch and up and shrug nice work,2,HasFit
this one really hits that whole posterior chain so important i always say in your front are the show muscles in the back of the go muscles basically means all your power and real athleticism comes from your backside,2,HasFit
come on keep it up you got it nice work not many left,2,HasFit
let's go five more seconds,2,HasFit
that's it and four three two one and zero finishing strong,2,HasFit
okay grab your seat beam,2,HasFit
got one so,2,HasFit
if you're doing your shoulder press say get seated feel free to grab it otherwise kicking them up getting right into it bring those dumbbells down to about in line with your ears,2,HasFit
maybe just a little bit lower really depends on your flexibility and what feels comfortable,2,HasFit
don't take it to a place,2,HasFit
it feels awkward with shoulders,2,HasFit
nice work core stays tight,2,HasFit
doesn't matter either one whichever one you're doing still stays tight nice work,2,HasFit
this is about that point in the workout,2,HasFit
where you start to really feel it it starts to kick in and it becomes all mental right now not even physical,2,HasFit
it's all up in your head,2,HasFit
it's all that mental toughness and grip that's going to keep you moving fighting,2,HasFit
through rep by rep,2,HasFit
let's go come on and five four three two one zero,2,HasFit
ahh all right feeling good moving on to a dumbbell curls,2,HasFit
we're hitting the biceps next,2,HasFit
let's get it both curling at the same time curling those pinkies in there we go arms are starting to be a little bit get a little bit lactic,2,HasFit
acid built up in them,2,HasFit
remember you don't have to listen to that,2,HasFit
that's just a pain signal but the muscles got plenty left,2,HasFit
you got this come on driving through curl those pinkies in shoulders are back nice,2,HasFit
work one right into the next good form not swinging the weights not getting a bunch of momentum involved almost there go five more seconds,2,HasFit
that's it and four three two one zero all right all right,2,HasFit
we're moving on to either a dumbbell squat or a dumbbell goblet squat from the chair,2,HasFit
i'll clean that name up later,1,HasFit
okay so we're doing going into our squats weights back in our hips making sure to break at the hips every time,2,HasFit
because if you don't what happens is you bend at the knees first and you end up here,2,HasFit
and then you're like oh man,2,HasFit
my knees hurt hips back then squat,2,HasFit
that's the key,2,HasFit
keep those feet flat drive off the heels nice work,2,HasFit
you got it every squat you do,2,HasFit
you're going to get that much better at it,2,HasFit
nobody starts great at these,2,HasFit

drive those knees out go at your tempo so this week we've been thinking about new perspectives,2,Video_2_nikeTrainerClub.txt
and what i have had to really think about this time is changing things and looking at everything as an opportunity you know,1,Video_2_nikeTrainerClub.txt
i'm used to going to the gym and lifting heavy things but what i've been loving is changing the tempos going faster on some reps maybe slowing down some things some of the movements that i'm so used to picking up heavy weight,1,Video_2_nikeTrainerClub.txt
i just use my body and challenge myself in such a different way and i look at it as a brand new opportunity,1,Video_2_nikeTrainerClub.txt
so that's my new perspective for this week and for the past few months last one,1,Video_2_nikeTrainerClub.txt
okay now we're going into a narrow and wide push-up so everything stays here,2,Video_2_nikeTrainerClub.txt

if you want more support now smash that thumbs up button and subscribe if you haven't already and let's get started,1,Chloe Ting
we've got 21 exercises across three sets in this workout 30 to 40 seconds on and 5 to 15 seconds off,2,Chloe Ting
remember to know your limits and go at your own pace and rely on the low impacts if you need them,2,Chloe Ting
let's start with knee,2,Chloe Ting
pull switch start by lifting your arms up one leg extended behind you,2,Chloe Ting
now pull down your arms as you bring your back knee up then jump to the other side and do the same,2,Chloe Ting
if you're new to this exercise do it slow and controlled,2,Chloe Ting
it requires a bit of coordination,2,Chloe Ting
land softly and don't injure your ankles for low impact just do without jumps [music] 10 seconds rest here and we've got skaters hop to one side laterally and bring one leg behind you without resting the back foot on the floor then jump to the other side keep your chest up and back neutral and do the moves in a controlled manner and for low impact,2,Chloe Ting
just take a big step instead of hopping from side to side and also go slower,2,Chloe Ting
[music] i see you looking at me,2,Chloe Ting
[music] next we've got squat reach then with your feet about shoulder width apart,2,Chloe Ting
keep your core and glutes engaged as you squat and reach your hands to the floor,2,Chloe Ting
now jump up from the floor bring your feet together or crisscross then jump back out into another squat and repeat if your hands can't touch the floor,2,Chloe Ting
that's okay do the best you can,2,Chloe Ting
you need to have good hips and ankle mobility to go low for low impact we're just doing squats with reach [music] but kicks are next guys,2,Chloe Ting
you're doing well,2,Chloe Ting
this is similar to a joke,1,Chloe Ting
but bring your back foot as close to your butt as possible,2,Chloe Ting
have your arms moving like so like you're sprinting,2,Chloe Ting
you can always do any of these exercises slower adjusted based on,2,Chloe Ting
your fitness level is totally fine to make [music] outer adjustments [music] my nicely done guys,2,Chloe Ting
just two more exercises and we're done with set one we're doing lateral lunge hop next,2,Chloe Ting
bring one leg to the side,2,Chloe Ting
while pushing your hips back and sitting down into a side lunge then get back to the center and do a hop for low impact,2,Chloe Ting
we're living out the hops instead,2,Chloe Ting
you can bring your knee up from outer space,2,Chloe Ting
[music] and now let's swap to the other leg,2,Chloe Ting
and that's the end of the first set,2,Chloe Ting
keep going guys,2,Chloe Ting
you're doing well [music] [music] and that said one,2,Chloe Ting
you can pause the video if you need a longer rest,2,Chloe Ting
it's important to stay safe and know your limits all right,2,Chloe Ting
now we've got touch ground cross over start in a forward lunge then shuffle jump towards the center,2,Chloe Ting
then repeat the same on the other side,2,Chloe Ting
make sure your back stays neutral and your front knee doesn't pass your toes,2,Chloe Ting
this exercise requires coordination,2,Chloe Ting
so try to practice this move slowly or you could do so without jumps,2,Chloe Ting
your body will learn and adapt so,2,Chloe Ting
don't worry if you can't master the moves the first time you tried it and for low impact we're just doing it without the jumps,2,Chloe Ting
i'll say i lost my [music] mind [music] all right next we're doing shuffle,2,Chloe Ting
crunch shuffle to your left then crunch and squeeze your abs,2,Chloe Ting
then repeat on the other side,2,Chloe Ting
you can bring your arms out laterally as you shuffle if you want to increase the intensity nice and slow for low impact all the time all the time [music] [music] next,2,Chloe Ting
we've got overhead to jumping jacks,2,Chloe Ting
make sure you're on a flat surface and that your mat doesn't slip,2,Chloe Ting
make sure you're doing it in good form and kind of robotic in a way engage your core too [music] [music] you're doing great guys,2,Chloe Ting
who are almost halfway through,2,Chloe Ting
we've got in and out squat necks while working your core your thighs and your booty here,2,Chloe Ting
keep pushing you can do it,2,Chloe Ting
[music] [music] great work next,2,Chloe Ting
we've got curtsy lunges,2,Chloe Ting
just three more exercises to the end of set two,2,Chloe Ting
you've got this guys,2,Chloe Ting
[music] bring one leg diagonally behind you as you lunge down then push off from your front heel to get back up and repeat on the other leg,2,Chloe Ting
if you find it hard to do cutscene lunges you can do reverse lunges somehow [music] that's how it goes when you hollywood perfect [music] nicely done we've got heinzmann next,2,Chloe Ting
we're going side to side bringing one leg up at a time,2,Chloe Ting
think of it as lateral sprinting high knee and for low impact,2,Chloe Ting
just go nice and slow remember to swap to low impacts whenever you feel too tired,2,Chloe Ting
that's what they're there for [music] our next final exercise of the second set while shuffling to one side,2,Chloe Ting
then squat down or you can start in a quarter squat and move laterally and do a full squat,2,Chloe Ting
[music] [applause] [music] hollywood [music] step 2 is done pause,2,Chloe Ting
the video here for a longer break [music] it's really important,2,Chloe Ting
you've rested enough as well getting down on the mat,2,Chloe Ting
make sure your heart rate is lowered before you get started with next set,2,Chloe Ting
let's start with push up to knee,2,Chloe Ting
tap do a regular push-up and have your elbows pointing out 45 degrees instead of flaring outwards,2,Chloe Ting
make sure you're squeezing your pegs as you get up and then tap your knee with your hand for low impact you can do the exercise on your knees,2,Chloe Ting
[applause] [music] great work guys now staying on mat and while doing some plank jacks into a burpee start with your hands directly below your shoulder jump,2,Chloe Ting
both feet outwards then jump both feet towards the chest then jump up into the air,2,Chloe Ting
this isn't the easiest exercise,2,Chloe Ting
but we gotta push through guys it's the last set,2,Chloe Ting
let's do this [music] and when you need to cry i'll be you're doing well guys,2,Chloe Ting
we're doing a walk out next then,2,Chloe Ting
some shoulder taps and then repeat work your upper body guys and this is an easy one so keep going you can do it jungle of love,2,Chloe Ting
[music] all right,2,Chloe Ting
now get into a reverse tabletop position and we're lifting your left leg up parallel to the floor and we're going to do some hip rest you're going to feel the burn in your glutes and triceps but keep pushing on and for low impact just do hip [music] breaths on one day and when you need to escape from just four more exercises to go,2,Chloe Ting
we are moving on to the other leg here,2,Chloe Ting
if you were doing low impact before you can spice it up by lifting your hands upwards like so [music] people say i try too hard,2,Chloe Ting
people say i come off really awkward crap toe touches on necks and we're touching the opposite feet with your hands,2,Chloe Ting
your arms might be burning right now but you can do it if you need to rest for a few seconds,2,Chloe Ting
it's okay take your rest and get back on it,2,Chloe Ting
don't know why people don't like me anymore,1,Chloe Ting
i do my best all on my own and i just rather be alone rather be alone,1,Chloe Ting
i have no friends but i'll be fine,1,Chloe Ting
i don't need them to pass the right now,1,Chloe Ting
flip around and we've got greatness,2,Chloe Ting
just two more exercises to go guys take a big step or hop to the side then back to the middle then to the other side this can be difficult for those who don't have hip mobility,2,Chloe Ting
so if that's the case you can try the low impact,2,Chloe Ting
don't quit now,2,Chloe Ting
just do the low impact if you need a small break [music] but that's okay great way guys stand upright and we're going to end the workout here with some high knees,2,Chloe Ting
