so still keeping that hollow through your belly keeping it nice and strong slow exhales,2
let's go hop hop chest up good really reach with a strong arm,2
we're both bending at the hips first driving those hips back and then coming down until our hips are parallel to the ground,2
five four three two and last one zero nice,2
all you need is yourself a mat if you have one of course some water because we're really gonna get after it today we're gonna start off,2
i don't really think it's fair to have the word just anywhere near this workout to be honest but it's there it's there loving the energy guys next up we've got oblique crunches it's gonna be two crunches on each side okay,2
roll it up feet together,2
we're here for it,2
only ready quick feet,2
i want you to take your feet about hip width,2
keep working through one two one two almost halfway well they might have a cheeky surprise for everybody who knows three two and one get some water guys hydrate halfway mark believe it or not i have designed this workout to be enjoyed,2
we're going to go to the ground for the next one,2
yeah it's nice and easy nice and controlled if you're feeling pretty good about your stability and you want to challenge yourself a little more,2
we're going to go back to those fast feet this time,2
let's work dig,2
yes we're focusing on our legs but you still want to think about those back muscles to keep that nice strong posture,2
we got this feel the burn,2
and i'm going to do this one from a standing position so from the box,2
we've got hamstring punches now so the opposite hamstring,2
two hands on one,2
are you quick,2
relax all right lay down now you can bend those knees,2
just go a little past your toe,2
you're going to go back to that,2
big breaths big breathes,2
yup go at your own pace you might notice your ankles are like oh whoa wobbly,2
try not to sway too much and we have one more exercise to go,2
jump it up jump it down,2
big inhale big exhale,2
it's a little easier standing a little harder standing it forces me to use a little bit more stability and a little bit more core but overall very comparable movements,2
now we're gonna take it and do some shoulder taps with a bare plank,2
perfect we want to alternate keeping those elbows in by your side perfect,2
i'm also going to lose a dumbbell here,2
keep that core strong,2
we got that core engaged all our impact,2
we are doing bicycles next,2
we'll have a finisher then,2
yeah it's okay just focus on you're slowing down your breath but next around what we do these,2
you can just take it slow now with lunch tab lunch slightly to one side and touch your toe with your opposite hand now,2
what motivates you and get there breathe,2
after this big reach up maybe straighten out those legs a little bit more,2
to a dumbbell tricep kickback,2

it's tough enough,2
i promise you come back repeat it get better,2
other side stagger the foot chest up,2
probably up on this one,2
just remember it's much better to start light and work your way up than the other way around the only other equipment that you may want for,2
there doesn't mean you have to do the whole thing,2
pause buttons there pause buttons your friend whenever you need to use it,2
then we're done so stay with me,2
we lower our legs to the lowest point,2
i don't know about you guys but i am sweaty,2

that's what gets you through the moments i know you can,2
i'm just as tired as you guys are,2

come on,2
off the ground and come back down so we are contracting the abs up at the top reaching up big and high you see i'm using my weights making it more difficult claudia,2
i know you said work at your own pace but we definitely don't want to make this a cardio and just start pumping out correct exactly reps,2
your legs are gonna feel like they're gonna fall but i promise they're gonna be there the whole time,2
keep marching three two one so we come,2
keep that core strong every punch every moment every single second matters if you need to pull up to come back and love that take a few seconds gather yourself come back in,2
