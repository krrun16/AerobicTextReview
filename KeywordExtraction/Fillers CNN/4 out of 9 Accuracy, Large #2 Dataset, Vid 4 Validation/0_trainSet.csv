the next move is a lateral lunge with the row,2
kick up your legs behind you fast load and bring up the speed for low impact,2
come on angie come on all the way out now all the way out look at that speed and power,2

you're a winner and you're win three two and one make no mistake about that,2

start with your best guesss,2
beautiful all right,2
alright stay with me here,2
we're halfway through the workout,2
nice and strong core tight,2
peel those hips down,2
we're starting with the row,2
i just want you to super strong on these,2
we are almost there,2
all right,2
it's not about keeping up,2
big inhale big exhale,2
your legs aren't gonna fall off,2
walk both legs and hands a site-to-site make sure your butt is not poking up and squeeze those abs,2
come on three two one,2
put it all out there right now,2
so thank you for that,2
just build more in your triceps when you go narrow,2
let's go three two one hold,2
this is a strength training routine so we don't want to,2
tap next start with push-up and then touch your toe with your opposite hand,2
you haven't already so step those feet out as wide as you can and then get it out nice and narrow still setting those hips back so in just a little bit,2
nice work guys come on keep it up one into the next this,2
so now i want you to drop it to one side square yourself to the shin and then fold yourself forward,2
only the mind can win at this point,2
we're kind of doing it now but i'm going to officially start it in a second and the first exercise is going to be a hooking knee with the left hand,2
you ready join me now and three two one take it down for four three two one reset bring it up down four three two one reset,2
nice come on forward good so nice and quick forward yes you got it forward,2
counts you ready here,2
i hope you're still with me,2
big spread through the chest,2
we're going to start with a warm-up we're going to go into a wide squat squat right here feet back in the center and then one to the other side good,2
we are running to it,2
you ready,2
i'm already feeling it breaking the sweat,2
that's just a pain signal but the muscles got plenty left,2
you can also take a longer break if you want to,2
you ready join me now,2
let's get it whoo,2
let's go last five,2
don't allow them to break or compress in nice work not much left on this one,2
we're getting the arms press it straight up all the way back down good chest up but don't forget to breathe squeeze those abs press it straight up,2
okay they're keeping you up keeping you strong three two hold,2
lower is not necessarily better on these,2
you can place your hands behind you for some stability,2
what are you saving it for,2
come on guys you can do it,2
that's how we feel,2
you ready to speed it up here,2
now i want you to try to extend the opposite leg when you're here,2
alright just kidding i want you to place your hands right underneath your shoulders,2
three two one tap it out now,2
we're not quitting,2
knees up good good,2
stick it hinge,2
can you ready join me now,2
the fingertips are just grazing,2
not angie's best,2
another combo movement this one we are getting hamstrings glutes lower back and your traps good and notice how both of us are keeping our backs,2
you've got that water,2
just bring one leg out at one time and bring them back in now,2
breathe control it so these metrics are so great because you can feel every single muscle in your body you can make sure you're doing the form right,2
good squeeze those sides together,2
we're pulling back at those elbows keeping our core nice and tight and if you're wondering why we didn't take a longer break even though we're beginners that's because the workout specifically designed to allow some muscles to rest while others are working so right now our backs working but at the same time our chest may be resting allows us to get a lot done in a short period of time again pulling back on those elbows anytime,2
jump to the other side,2
angie's going high impact me and wade,2
she's putting some punches in,2
quick feet with those hips switches,2
you didn't want us in this too much on you,2
all right hinge slow break,2
so we're driving off the heels and squeezing our glutes and pressing up at the same time nice work and again on any of these,2
shoulders are back,2
it's good pain,2
believe in yourself believe you can because you can and you will this workout,2
you can take a break whenever you need to,2
we're gonna drop the knees side to side,2
switch switch switch switch yes squad come on kersey you still with me,2

right here right now,2
let's go keep those shoulders off the ground,2
keep your core tight and at the top,2
here we go,2
not perfection do your best march whenever you have to be strong three two and one and a nice march next one is a touch and knee raise,2
let's go stay with it desire drive,2
it's about desire,2
so we're gonna go slow slow slow and then drive it up,2
that's the key,2
not ready for that,2
this is no longer physical understand that your body wants to give up,2
two and one here,2
we go hamstring punches,2
peel yourself up and off the ground with the shoulders long down your back so really try to actively push in the ground,2
if this is too hot you can do a side plank hole now,2
we're going back to the hollow,2
come on,2
you can do it for low impact,2
we're taking it into a squat so sitting back driving the knees out,2
okay now we're going into a narrow and wide push-up so everything stays here,2

i'll give you guys a side view here squatting make sure you keep those knees out,2
are you ready deep breathes,2
alright peel yourself up off the ground,2
work one right into the next using good form not swinging the weights not getting a bunch of momentum involved almost there let's go five more seconds that's it and four three two one zero all right all right,2
let's go nice work,2
she wore down nice,2
get them punches,2
yeah come on ten seconds come on squad,2
thank you for pushing everyone around you so keep that back flat shoulders back,2
we're going to eccentric so i'm going to cue you down for four seconds and then you're just gonna warm yourself up because the focus here is the lowering faze,2
we want the back of the room,2
keep that chest up weight in the center,2
we're gonna start our stretch,2
give me one more chest up curl the dumbbells and press it up,2
you're with me,2
we're gonna tap down and the tap behind your head tap down tap behind your head,2
but we're doing it together,2
you notice how she's holding the weight up with two hands and i got a my thumbs out,2
no swinging no swinging because now all of a sudden all the other muscles are taking over we just want to isolate the triceps on this one you got it ten more seconds,2
let's go you guys,2

you can always bring it back in to that hollow,2
press it back good chest up all the way down up squeeze now we know the moves so we can get into it down up,2
we're just gonna start to bounce side to side getting that heart rate up,2
nice deep breaths engage work through,2
keep the hip as level as you,2
and then everything stays wide arms close arms wide arms close arms wide,2
push yourself back into that high plank,2
we squeeze that muscle between the knee and the bum,2
stand it up tap it out so we're not done yet,2
you're breaking glass and you might notice one sides a little bit harder than the other and that's totally fine,2
push right now up,2
we can perseverance resilience desire,2
we go fast as you can now core strong,2
you can go slow,2
let's start with butt kickers,2
yes forward forward,2
oh i'm really sorry about this guy's we're doing it again but i'm changing the order,2
the glass almost fell over,2
don't save anything,2
i'm gonna do a dumbbell squat just at my side so i'm going to be able to get a little bit deeper than doing the chair or box squat but either way,2
we're using that elbow as a lever,2
let's get it so on these totally fine to be on your knees,2
you have one left after this and then we go to our cardio move beautiful,2
extend that leg back if you feel comfortable or you can keep it on the ground,2
you can kind of stand to like this,2
let's go down four three two one recover now,2
we did it in the warm-up but now we're going single leg slight bend in the leg hinge slow and then drive it up nice and easy at your own pace,2
you ready three two one,2
take a couple deep breaths,2
fortunately we've got a little bit of time off cardio now,2
thank you so much for being here,2
okay so we're going to start with the march we're gonna pick it up three two one core tight 20 seconds and we're gonna move straight into that hooking knee breathe breathe breathe,2
you should feel it more in that front leg but you definitely will feel it a little bit in that back especially in that hip flexor so keep it straight keep it forward,2
that's who we are three two and one and march,2
give me that squat,2
because if you don't what happens is you bend at the knees first and you end up here,2
3 2 & 1,2
that's it guys are doing great,2
we're moving on to either a dumbbell squat or a dumbbell goblet squat from the chair,2
this definitely works,2

with our warmup then we'll go with a little core then we'll get that heart rate up a little bit then we'll take it to a strength set then we'll start interweaving that little agility set,2
i didn't forget about you,2
it's 20 seconds of each of them back-to-back so 20 seconds of marching fast or running 20 seconds of punches and 20 seconds and ease and 20,2

big inhale and you are done you guys crush that every time you come into that room you get stronger you get better,2
we got 10 more seconds on this one feeling,2
we've jumped next,2
then bring the leg back and get into a tabletop position and kick the other leg up touching your hand,2
let's go ahead and place the hand down we're gonna bring it back to that high plank,2
if you didn't bring those hands up maybe try it this time ready,2
i want them to be your best,2
my team kicks booty flat back,2
good five four,2
this one really hits that whole posterior chain so important,2
those are hard,2
we're going to curl those pinkies in on the way up and then all the way back down again,2
that's it fighting through,2
you can put a little dip in there as well if you want to be strong,2
we have five come on four three two one and plank hold 20 seconds,2
i don't think i can do that,2
this may look familiar to you,2
so sit back into child's pose and really reach through for those fingertips big inhale big exhales,2
switch yeah come on switch switch switch come on come on stay with me,2

that's it and four three two one and zero finishing strong,2
mm-hmm you got it,2
i am loving this,2
five four let's go for three two get an extra one plank,2
but instead i feel that time under tension feel those muscles contracting all the way up and all the way down you got it,2
you're squeezing that back of the arm squeezing your triceps up at the top nice work notice,2
knowing that we can all push together is what gets me motivated so i need you come on three two one plank,2
relax other side slight bend in the leg,2
so now we're gonna bring it back to standing so place the foot on the ground we're gonna bring one leg forward one leg back,2
it's okay especially if you're not used to doing balance work,2
keep that tailbone tucked,2
you want to make sure you keep breathing,2
one straight supporting leg flat back back to the middle good lunge row down but let's pick up that pace okay,2
bend those knees walk those hands back,2
yeah exactly she's only gonna use one weight good point so she's going to do a goblet squat,2
are you with me for our last round,2
now we have be up with straight-leg crunch try your best to do this in good form and i hope your ass is on fire right now,2
you can add some push-ups or you can try knee push-ups now flip around and have your elbow resting on a mat,2
don't feel like you have to use the same weight for all of them,2
that's a good thing,2
let's pull pull so if you want to make this harder,2
squeeze those quads push energy through your heels happy thoughts,2
now we have double hop burpees starting high playing then jumbo feet in and out and eat again then get up and do another jump off the ground for low impact,2
okay now we're gonna go back into the ground and similar to our you eccentrics that we did with our push-ups and our split squat,2
but before that we're gonna work for 20 seconds in a squat in a speed squat or a squat,2
now we're not going to count any repetitions today,2
you won't have the stability from the ground,2
switch switch switch and relax yes all right we are done with those fast feet and i see my chicago families in the chat,2
oh okay stand up now,2
let's go now come on,2
let's get that explosive,2

so now we're gonna go into a hinge,2
my knees out as i sit back chest is up,2
you're not going here right,2
we've got another litter little finisher,2
it feels awkward with your shoulders,2
i want you to pretend like you're pushing the ground away from you here whoo big exhales and i know my girl kirstie gotso is was working out with us this morning,2
you just want to really drive through that front heel to bring yourself back to standing position,2
you've got that towel at any time,2
that's different than saying you have to do every single moment but you can be doing it with us feeling this now already,2
good back is nice and flat last one back to the middle good set your weights down because we have our first cardio move arms come up nice smash it right down,2
the side of your body knee comes up big exhale each time,2
it's gotta be then you've got to find it from somewhere,2
you can bend those knees a little bit for a little more space big reach up take it back down,2
that doesn't give you much time,2
okay so be in this plank position row row ready,2
we got this desire drive determination taking it up a level with a real start plus today if you're here today you're a warrior,2
30 seconds here shoulder blades off the ground big inhales and exhales,2
stand it up shake it off you are done with that circuit,2
they're the things that matter,2
i'll give you one version for the first round and then each round i'll add on a little progression so first up we're gonna bring those shoulder blades off the ground,2
quick let's get it get low,2
we go three two one,2
we're breathing just 10 more seconds left on this one fight through you got it and three two one and zero alright,2
