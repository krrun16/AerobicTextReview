remember the lower,2
we go get that core strong engage,2
three two one tap tap,2
side come on side,2
i mean it's not right there so we're getting there up next three,2
but don't just keep the weight if it's not if you're not able to complete the reps in a safe manner or the other way if it's not challenging you make sure to up the weight so you can get that full benefit nice work driving off the heels pressing straight up keep it up guys almost there and five four three two one zero,2
i don't know step it,2
you're not resting here you'll be hovering before you push back up so you should feel it in your thighs your upper body your glutes and your lower back try to use really smooth movements about 15 second flush right next up we have squats plus side lifts so then do a lift on each side in between their squat,2
just two more exercises to go guys take a big step or hop to the side then back to the middle then to the other side this can be difficult for those who don't have hip mobility,2
we're gonna work the triceps,2
change your body change your life,2
ten seconds left five seconds all right,2
we'll get two more just like that big reach up and then last one take it down,2
i'm gonna take a little breather - it's ok,2
keep working through almost halfway,2
good job we've got a few more just like that,2
but if you're feeling pretty good i want to see that glass break,2
you taught me everything,2
i have designed this workout to be enjoyed,2
keeping your heels hovered as we extend your arms up over the chest squeezing our body together option,2
you're straight so your posture is strong,2
but before that we're gonna work for 20 seconds in a squat in a speed squat or a squat,2
don't quit now,2
we're up on our feet and try to keep the pace up a little bit faster for the second round because we know what we're doing we're going to stiff leg deadlift or our dl+ shrug kick back,2
[music] [applause] [music] hollywood [music] step 2 is done pause,2
here we are here,2
if you find it hard to do cutscene lunges you can do reverse lunges somehow [music] that's how it goes when you hollywood perfect [music] nicely done we've got heinzmann next,2
give me that squat,2
second round of those sidestep jacks so,2
but this time we're gonna change it up a little bit if you feel pretty good on these,2
let's go you guys down down down,2
good one more each side and back to the mill,2
that's going to go right into ten reps of a forward arm circle bringing those arms out nice and wide,2
yeah build that tension through the ground few more here last one and one all right,2
don't worry if it takes you a second to get it,2
now how good do you feel having done that session today,2
no three jacks repeat this time leading with the different leg,2
your best effort is what i want to see,2
everything nice and strong,2
two one remember you do not have to touch the floor,2
the other day i've got about 20 seconds in with weights and i thought i'll give them to angie because i can do that,2
here we go up,2
you're feeling warm,2
yeah whoo keep it strong few more slow slow slow drive it up all right other side,2
i want you to squeeze your buns nice and tight abs in tight,2
come on come on anthony,2
let's go remember,2
the clock keeps ticking,2
stand it up tap it out so we're not done yet,2
let's go five more seconds on this one and four three two one and done okay,2
lift up i'm trying to make this as controlled as you can,2
we're go ahead turn to the side so you can see,2
use your core to keep you strong,2
today's workout's going to consist of six blocks including a warm-up and a flexibility block before we start each block,2
now's the time to pause,2
maybe just a little bit lower really depends on your flexibility and what feels comfortable,2
wade loving that bud,2
take a sip of water if you need it but these are quick,2
just some nice deep breaths here all right,2
this is round one of three,2
i'm gonna do a quick cool down so bring your feet apart,2
i know you're tired but i'm right here with you,2
lean forward as much as you need to you to get a good stretch right now tilt forward straight in here,2
so if that's the case you can try the low impact,2
i'm going to go all the way down,2
we're gonna count on our bellies next up,2
we're gonna start our stretch,2
extend that leg back if you feel comfortable or you can keep it on the ground,2
it's not gonna be dramatic,2
we're going low fast march,2
we're going to go back to those fast feet this time,2
keep your body as stiff as you can down four three push energy through your heels,2
three two one all right dig into the floor,2
let's go last four three two one woohoo all right bridge march now so again peeling the hips off the ground dig into the floor three two one,2
pull switch start by lifting your arms up one leg extended behind you,2
ahh all right feeling good moving on to a dumbbell curls,2
we know these hurts your mind ready,2
we got to go the other way on those switches so catch your breath my heart rates up,2
doesn't matter either one whichever one you're doing still stays tight nice work,2
so let's just get right into it,2
[music] [music] all right,2
we've got 20 total there 10 on each side last exercise ready to work that core a little bit more alright layin,2
hold come on switch drive those elbows back squeeze hold switch switch so the wider,2
and this sides a little wobbly for me all right last one drive it up,2
we're gonna come lie on one side we're gonna do one side for 45 seconds,2
all right flip over into the front position on your hands next up,2
i'm going to start with this leg,2
that's great never question yourself every moment that you move your body is a step towards the outcomes that you want,2
don't take it to a place,2
through rep by rep,2
all the way down on our back,2
if you want to step it up mm-hmm just add in some jumps,2
nice work not much left more than halfway done with this one already here,2
other side stagger the foot chest up,2
we stretch out the front of those thighs quadriceps,2
bend your knees until you can get to the floor,2
this might feel really new to you,2
[music] engage those abs as you bring the knee up [music] [music] [music] [music] so keep that foot parallel meaning the top of your foot,2
ready to get this thing,2
you're ready angie,2
as well for that warm-up two one here we go just side to side enjoy the easy stuff,2
then we're done so stay with me,2
it means we're going to the ground,2
we're going to do one light each for 45 seconds,2
get that scoop,2
your deep runners lunge go down as far as you need to to get a good stretch,2
health is in the mind more than in the body your strength and your character in your heart if you like in your spirit,2
just take a big step instead of hopping from side to side and also go slower,2
it defeats the purpose,2
yep everyone's doing great stay with me three two one,2
next up we have ten total reps of an alternating reverse lunge,2
keep that chest up,2
come on up,2
enjoy being with us,2
alright just kidding i want you to place your hands right underneath your shoulders,2
i just want you to finish with us,2
press into your supporting leg into that heel strong kicks few more seconds,2
that's halfway 10 seconds left 3 2 1 right next up we're doing the supine plank reach so this one's kind of fun we're gonna start on one side,2
yep so if you want to make it switch easier you could bring your feet wider switch or you can bring them more narrow to make it more challenging switch,2
you don't want your back getting loose or allowing your abs to relax almost there on this one,2
stay here for a couple breaths,2
let's do let's work,2
otherwise a good job,2
it's about doing it right,2
three two one rest,2
let's go to the side good,2
i don't really think it's fair to have the word just anywhere near this workout to be honest but it's there it's there loving the energy guys next up we've got oblique crunches it's gonna be - crunches on each side okay,2
both palms come up,2
we're actually switching out the last exercise which was obliques before,2
come on angie look at the speed ha work through now come on drive desire,2
you want to make sure you keep breathing,2
that's what they're there for [music] our next final exercise of the second set while shuffling to one side,2
good morning to you awesome job,2
row it back down,2
it's rising up three,2
all the way up hips forward,2
let's go 40 seconds,2
you're not working during push-up also,2
we've got three two one and recover all right we're going back to those hollow holds,2
come back down,2
i'm feeling the pain we're all there,2
nice work core stays tight,2
so guess what,2
slight bend in the leg chest up,2
press it up good,2
relax okay,2
you feel a good stretch right now,2
let's swing it on around alright so now we're going into those bare planks again,2
it's okay to do that while you're working out your option here,2
is it right here,2
we'll drive through the heel bring it back together,2
i know you said work at your own pace,2
that's okay do the best you can,2
ten seconds ah breathe,2
jump squeeze those glutes at the top and also squeeze your inner thighs together,2
because if you don't what happens is you bend at the knees first and you end up here,2
let's push,2
this kind of stuff makes it a lot,2
we've got a few more just like this squad so we will revisit this hinge later on in a single leg position whoo last one all right so warm up feeling good,2
come on work through,2
keep those feet flat drive off the heels nice work,2

knee comes up big exhale each time,2
go through that finish line,2
i want to stay there,2
acid built up in them,2
we go so down,2
the list goes on but it's a very efficient movement getting a lot of work in in a short period of time,2
and then everything stays wide arms close arms wide arms close arms wide,2
i got for you and then boom,2
not perfection do your best march whenever you have to be strong three two and one and a nice march next one is a touch and me raise okay and we're gonna touch and raise into the right knee so fast pace keep marching,2

top of your hips over knees over,2
pause buttons there those buttons your friend whenever you need to use it,2

i'm gonna pick up the pace a little bit,2
we're just getting those legs,2

now we're gonna take it and do some shoulder taps with a bare plank,2
make sure your knee is in line with your heel on that reverse lunge chest up good take it straight back michelle,2
you can go to it and three in two and in one that was 40 seconds of work breathe,2
so you're doing one right and one left,2
you're feeling good virtual high fives right now,2
keep those shoulders back and square,2
i'll answer some of your questions,2
make sure your back stays neutral and your front knee doesn't pass your toes,2
it's okay we need to go to your knees,2
we've got hamstring punches now so the opposite hamstring,2
hold okay and i know,2
but you're not stopping just five seconds left all right so we're doing that lunge with rotation like i said even more bit challenge,2

so many walls going on right,2
stretch as far as you can for the entire way it all the way the top now lean to one side ever so slightly gently as far as you can no the other more time on each side next,2
yeah let's get stretched off,2
that's it and four three two one zero all right all right,2
we're going to flip over to the other side so one call and extend back up and extend straighten that leg as much as you can,2
you ready for those burpees here,2
you go the tougher it is if you feel a twinge in your lower back just stop immediately pushing through dig in it working hard suck up the adrenaline 40 seconds of work,2
we got to put it in personal best personal best effort,2
and you're really squeezing that outer thigh and that glute muscle [music] slow and controlled test for balance,2
keep working on,2
come on you're why i work hard,2
come on but we do this together,2
let's go almost there,2
yes forward forward,2
but then we've got twenty seconds in a plank,2
press that lower back into the floor,2
the center of your chest is gonna get the cardio going abs working,2
you do want to keep that low back pressed into the ground so go ahead and raise those feet up just a little bit and then shoulders come up as well opposite shoulder to opposite knee so we are twisting through that core keeping that tummy tight,2
join me now here,2
and today i have a body weight only cardio workout for you,2
full body routine is a no repeat workout meaning we are going to be doing 20 different exercises for 20 minutes and it is also apartment friendly so there is no jumping involved in this workout,2
and you're way up there now you're gonna stay here and kind of walk so put your weight in one leg,2
a good breeze breathe in three,2
use those arms,2
but if you're not it definitely takes a lot of core work honestly something like this is a million times better for your abs than any kind of crunch you could ever think of ten seconds left so whichever leg you had extended last time is coming in,2
we go to the other side and don't forget we have more of these workouts available on the ntc app and ntc premium is free in the us right now has amazing programs in there,2
bring one leg to the side,2
i promise you it's work putting in the work right here and you will see the results,2
it's all winning,2
you're doing well [music] [music] and that said one,2
come on three two one,2
let's go down curl and press beautiful all right,2
i want you to try to get those biceps by those ears,2
you can let that a knee,2
please press pause whenever you have to take an extra break whenever you need to and watch and breathe,2
you got to keep stepping up,2
there's hardly any muscles,2
so you're really then get that action on your bleach squeezing that muscle down here,2
we're going to get three times okay,2
okay grab your seat beam,2
if you have one big reach up nice and high bend those knees and walk it out into a high plank position rock forward and back maybe on those wrists a little bit maybe side to side and then walk your hands back,2
the physical body can do so much,2
remember to know your limits and go at your own pace and rely on the low impacts if you need them,2
so this is a really great workout for you so you don't disturb those neighbors or if you have a sleeping baby in the next room,2
you can always reduce the range of motion if you need to,2
come on almost there up,2

land softly and don't injure your ankles for low impact just do without jumps [music] 10 seconds rest here and we've got skaters hop to one side laterally and bring one leg behind you without resting the back foot on the floor then jump to the other side keep your chest up and back neutral and do the moves in a controlled manner and for low impact,2
i hope you're ready for a great workout,2
then we'll hinge and then bring it back up so i want you to feel the difference between these two movements with that squat you're bending those knees feeling it more in those quads and that hinge you should feel in the back of those legs so sit it back hinge it forward huh,2
it is flowing through your body and changing your body,2
while you're doing these exercises make sure you're not doing kind of half half-hearted jumping jack motion keep your arms straight try to move slower if you have to and get the full range of motion instead of doing a quick no not full effort version 10 seconds left to one all right,2
that deep lunge and straighten that way which is breaching for that toe,2
you guys are doing great,2
you guys been hanging out with us working out really getting after it and being a really great example for everyone around you so thank you for that all right one more time on the fast feet with a forward jumps three two one,2

we stand marching on in to the power punches,2
i didn't forget about you,2
you might want to march slow,2
i lied so squat and then come right back up with your weight in that leg,2
yeah come on ten seconds come on squad,2
we'll switch sides so go in a tempo that feels good for you so notice my front toe or my back,2

i'm also going to lose a dumbbell,2
muhammad ali,2
we'll take it to two different movement patterns here first,2
push right now up,2
what weight works for you on this one,2
every single moment that passes push push push work three two and one and march,2
now pull down your arms as you bring your back knee up then jump to the other side and do the same,2
i promise it's almost over breathe,2
are you quick,2
that's three two one all right last time on the bridge march,2
nice work guys come on keep it up one into the next this,2
deliver yourself to that man,2
we're moving on to either a dumbbell squat or a dumbbell goblet squat from the chair,2
we're going to need both weights for this one,2
that lunge you're also working your core about halfway already if you're not feeling very warmed up yet or if you're new to exercise you can just keep your lunge nice and shallow and just kind of step forward instead of a really deep lunge but if you want to make it harder sink down into it,2
elbows are gonna stay out nice and wide now from here,2
we're just here to move,2
let's go five seconds,2
make sure you're doing it in good form and kind of robotic in a way engage your core too [music] [music] you're doing great guys,2
we're going to curl those pinkies in on the way up and then all the way back down again,2
don't matter anymore you do have time,2
keep working keep going,2
we squeeze that muscle between for me and the varmint pulled the hamstring,2
we're going to either do a stiff leg,2
switch switch switch and relax yes all right we are done with those fast feet and i see my chicago families in the chat,2
congratulations i hope,2
we're just gonna take into a regular reverse lunge so stepping it back,2
let's go bring that knee to your chest,2
seven seconds two one all right drop down to the floor,2
whoo all right drive it up remember,2
that's the tricky ly depressing place,2
we're gonna go through that a few times here so i have to give a shout-out to my girl so super sam for creating today's amazing playlist and she's also a fella filipina and we're celebrating asian pacific american heritage month here at nike so we got to represent the pinas,2
we're gonna hit those triceps next save movement really just to put a mix up your weight find,2
little bunch is quite easy while our muscles are warming up,2
you can take a break whenever you need to,2
look at that three,2
what a great session,2
we're winning this is the halfway mark three two one here,2
join me if you haven't already use your hands on the ground to give you some stability give you a little leverage because you want to keep the hips nice and stable as you're moving through these and really thinking about keeping the ribcage down and the tailbone tucked up so breathe,2
so you gotta keep going mom come on 10 more seconds,2
but i'm going to officially start it in a second and the first exercise is going to be a hooking knee with the left hand,2
we came here,2
i know you can see it but i can right,2
so we're driving off the heels and squeezing our glutes and pressing up at the same time nice work and again on any of these,2
i want you to pretend like you're pushing the ground away from you here whoo big exhales and i know my girl kirstie gotso is was working out with us this morning,2
because i want to keep the energy high and i've got a little treat for you,2
counts you ready here,2
don't save anything,2
we're pulling back at those elbows keeping our core nice and tight and if you're wondering why we didn't take a longer break even though we're beginners that's because the workout specifically designed to allow some muscles to rest while others are working so right now our backs working but at the same time our chest may be resting allows us to get a lot done in a short period of time again pulling back on those elbows anytime,2
eight reps of everything,2
hey gotta keep going core strong desire now push push dig,2
let's get right into it,2
right now,2
all you need is to set a little bit of time for yourself straight your legs and then you can go on with your day,2
but we're going to start picking up here after this so again if this is too easy step up the intensity of your rest otherwise here we are so,2
drop it down squad,2
probably up on this one,2
i went over your toes coming up,2
[music] i see you looking at me,2
heart rate is probably still a little high,2
there's one's about alright,2
cool it off high knees all right,2
this is no longer physical understand that your body wants to give up,2
all right,2
walk it in and up,2
if you didn't bring those hands up maybe try it this time ready,2
big spread through the chest,2
let the calm happy thoughts swell through your body because this is it we have five seconds,2
i want you to pretend like there's hot,2
three two one here,2
i want you to be your best,2
we're going to a staggered stance squat now,2
today i'm bringing you a 20 minute,2
five seconds left here,2
have your arms moving like so like you're sprinting,2
with our warmup then we'll go with a little core then we'll get that heart rate up a little bit then we'll take it to a strength set then we'll start interweaving that little agility set,2
so we're bent over our elbows are up,2
we're gonna speed this up and we're gonna have an option to go plyo jumping from in and out but when we speed it up if you want to go plyo go for it or if you are like i don't feel like jumpin and just move a little faster okay,2
you're doing great,2
your body will learn and adapt so,2
you work for yourself and to improve your fitness really well because you can always alter it modify it and push yourself when you need to and then lay back when off in intensity a little bit,2
last exercise some more spots really around the legs and glutes,2
nice big strong kick instead of a go down okay,2
two one here we go sit down turn to each side come back up so after this point of the routine now that you're nice and warmed up you can also make it quite a lot harder by adding weight so holding onto weights while you do,2
i'll add one more after this one guys,2
come on angie,2
let's go up,2
you don't want to be just throwing it up there,2
one more set of finishers,2
eight reps of everything,2
break rabbits if you need it we're going into circuit number three,2
we're just gonna start to bounce side to side getting that heart rate up,2
all that took was a short amount of time to break that sweat,2
pulse it out and up rise so this is a really nice explosive movement,2
keep your heels on the ground and then one at a time you're gonna bring that knee to the opposite shoulder again,2
come on you've got this,2
hip up plus chest press,2
how fun is it that we get to work out together,2
not the one that you're raising right,2
remember you don't have to listen to that,2
he's the other leg up as high as you can,2
that's how it's feeling like a nice stretch through the quads low-impact i'll say again,2
don't rush,2
big breaths hot new plants,2
i want you to put your toes out in a nice plie squat position elbows behind you right by your ears,2
knowing that we can all push together is what gets me motivated so i need you come on three two one plank,2
if you haven't already join me please join me,2
apart as she steps back you're gonna notice that the weight distribution is about mid foot to heel which is allowing that need to stay behind the toe an option here,2
going the other way three two one,2
if you're not feeling a stretch in the back of your leg then i want to make sure you drive in those hips back just a little bit in those knees and hips,2
what a fantastic effort keep marching,2
keep crushing it,2
breathe control it so these metrics are so great because you can feel every single muscle in your body you can make sure you're doing the form right,2
i can't keep up with this,2
keep your feet moving for a little arm work in there,2
we're both pulling back on our elbows,2
try to pull in your core again,2
so we're going to turn our hips back so it's like a little fancy dance,2
i am loving this,2
drive those knees out go at your tempo so this week we've been thinking about new perspectives,2
it's important to stay safe and know your limits all right,2
drive it up,2
you're coming back down into center,2
this workout is designed to be tough,2
swing those legs around,2
but actually i'm using my feet so your toes otherwise you're here take your leg up as high as you can,2
we're going to reach up to the ceiling,2
bend the knee,2
this may look familiar to you,2
then we'll be done so let's just go ahead and meet at the back of the mat here,2
so we're going to move on to some shoulder presses next,2
and so get into that standing set position shoulders are gonna be stocked right over,2
if you feel like they're feeling pretty challenging for you you can even bend those knees a little bit,2
try to get a little crunch,2
nice chandler perfect when the knees,2
jump what you got,2
i'm gonna bring our heart rate down and stretch out those muscles so keep your feet moving for a second,2

our knees are bent 90 degrees with our ankles directly underneath our knees,2
go slow or you can go past,2

alright stay with me here,2
stretch all through here,2
keep working come on,2
you have three exercises for a total of three rounds,2
everything we do here we will start is one low-impact and two standing so you could be confident that you can be involved in the work out the whole way through,2
so now we're gonna go into a hinge,2
let's go come on and five four three two one zero,2
yeah you're making it look good though all right exercise number two,2
so we're driving our hips backwards,2
go ahead pause,2
stay nice and under control you want to fling or swing the dumbbells around keep your core tight,2
we're getting close tap those feet out now,2
take it back down and honestly the combination of both is a really great way to make pretty much any routine,2
hopefully we're halfway,2
claudia's going to grab our box,2
we want the back of the room,2
keeping those elbows tucked in nice and tight to the body pulling back we're keeping our core tight and straight and our upper body is on a 45 degree angle,2
after this big reach up maybe straighten out those legs a little bit more,2
peel yourself up and off the ground with the shoulders long down your back so really try to actively push in the ground,2
take it back down,2
alright you can be on your toes for this or you be on your knees join me,2
we got five four three two and one done okay,2
we're going to drive off our heels and at the same time we're going to press the dumbbell straight up and back down getting a lot of different body parts worked in this one,2
we're doing a lunge plus a bow,2
this isn't the easiest exercise,2
let's go nice work,2
you're doing a row you want to be like you have a string attached to your elbows and you're just pulling back on it,2
and she's going high impact being wide,2
flip around and we've got greatness,2
come on,2
we really want to open up the chest and shoulders with this once,2
i want you to sit here,2
what motivates you and get there,2
we hit do you want to make this harder,2
we're going to do you come across,2
she's going to slowly raise her arms up hinging at her hips and till her range of motion allows keeping that back nice and flat once she reaches there then she'll lower her arms so slowly but surely she's feeling that stretch in her hamstrings as she continues to flex her feet,2
you are going to do one leg for 45 seconds,2
we go three two one,2
you ready to get sweaty,2
you ready join me now,2
we lower our legs to the lowest point,2
just three more exercises to the end of set two,2
believe in yourself believe you can because you can and you will this workout,2
it's about desire,2
feel that stretch see,2
let me see how you're doing beautiful and straight back nice perfect last --shoe and good last one everyone up down lunge perfect,2
you got this,2
you should feel it more in that front leg but you definitely will feel it a little bit in that back especially in that hip flexor so keep it straight keep it forward,2
we're crushing it together,2
you can bring your arms out laterally as you shuffle if you want to increase the intensity nice and slow for low impact all the time all the time [music] [music] next,2
we're living out the hops instead,2
we got to do it,2
we're gonna lower extend our legs down to the ground,2
don't worry if you can't master the moves the first time you tried it and for low impact we're just doing it without the jumps,2
we're gonna go ahead and demonstrate those exercises and then pause the video so that you can do the work,2
shoulders are back yup squad,2
just listen to my cue and go up up good arms and by your side like the ground was hot if you were in like a beautiful desert,2
you can always make it harder if you need to,2
we go two jacks lift next up,2
want that knee to stay in line with that heel so look down,2
100 reps in this 30-second time period,2
so that's the main difference,2
so that's why i love the strength train,2
we're gonna work that core a little bit so we have our opposite knee to opposite elbow so d is bringing her elbow up bringing that knee making sure that rotation is coming from the core less so from the upper body now of course if that range of motion is not available to you you can go ahead,2
you're going to want to do the same so if i jump last here you jump right first,2
two one here we go,2
we're going to 1 press back to plank position you can do this push up on your knees or on your toes push up push up,2
off the ground and come back down to earth contracting the abs up at the top reaching up big and high you see i'm using my weights making it more difficult claudia,2
next up we're doing a lunge plus a rotation five seconds left,2
perfect one more each side back to the middle last one good work perfect all right move to,2
i'm going to use two,2
you're gonna do 10 20 and then 10 for those exercises,2
weee of your head all the way to your leg,2
do your jobs here,2
we're done with those ten,2
i am nice and sweaty,2
it requires a bit of coordination,2
there we go so keeping nice and strong you can have weights with you like angie,2
straighten out so the resting point of this motion is tucking your hand in right here and then we're gonna press up so we get a lot of glute work on each side stretch before you tuck that down again,2
if you feel good or you can just stay here,2
you're gonna take a seat all the way down to the ground for your seated toe reach here so sitting up nice and tall up on your sit bones with your feet flexed,2
i'm doing that stretch,2
i know i use variation of walk downs and my routines often because i love them they feel good but they work so many different muscles,2
i'll come back up so whatever your range of motion is you have to respect it and never push it stretch to where it hurts,2
okay so now we're going into a plank row with a hold so when i say you're gonna pull and hold and then you'll switch when i say drive those elbows back and hold,2
it through core strong we got it,2
move back left about half way got about ten seconds left to run okay,2

except angie me always that's off-limits as much as you might want to three two and one march it out,2
so still keeping that hollow through your belly keeping it nice and strong slow exhales,2
get your breath slowed down a little bit,2
i don't think ng likes me as much as she did before other side three two one here we go so i like a little arm movement,2
we're gonna move very shortly so for this next circuit all you're gonna need is one dumbbell,2

come on two one,2
i just want you to super strong on these,2
and we throw a punch out,2
then repeat on the other side,2
make that the rest as hard as you need to,2

we got this feel the burn,2
we've got our handy dandy coffee jugs here just in place of our weights,2
let's dig,2
we're looking for five minutes of work here now,2
you're breaking glass and you might notice one sides a little bit harder than the other and that's totally fine,2
keep that posture tall,2
make sure your body's in a straight line we activated our core and our glutes a lot so you want to make sure you're focusing on keeping everything squeezed everything active,2
i'm so hot,2

what about up one more exercise,2
big inhale big exhale get that blood moving flowin wakin up that body perfect nice and easy light on those toes,2
we couldn't do it without you literally,2
i know your legs are probably starting to feel it,2
that's the other thing right,2
this routine is great for both men and women of a beginner fitness level,2
go ahead hit that pause button get started you all right so block number one,2
we did it in the warm-up but now we're going single leg slight bend in the leg hinge slow and then drive it up nice and easy at your own pace,2
start with your best gas,2
let's do this my son [music] and that's the workout guys,2
stick it hinge,2
we've been loving having you every single week at our workouts,2
[music] all right,2
they're the things that matter,2
we're going to do the whole thing with you,2
alright we're gonna go for five more ready five four three,2
to a dumbbell tricep kickback,2
you can put a little bit in there as well if you want to be strong,2
that's fine,2
that's right we always stick it out right,2
if you're doing your shoulder press say get seated feel free to grab it otherwise kicking them up getting right into it bring those dumbbells down to about in line with your ears,2
yup go at your own pace you might notice your ankles are like oh whoa wobbly,2
we've got three rounds of this burpees and plank so keep it strong,2
we'll go two more each side,2
it's tough enough,2
if you need it looking good their way the next exercise is gonna be a shoulder,2
show me that game freak,2
rest so if you're not sweating at all you know we're several minutes and at this point we're quite good ways in so you can start to really step up those intensities of both the intervals and your rest periods all right - knee pulls so like i said the harder version start jumping around and you can always mix it - so if you're here and you start to get winded well your motions start to get sloppy,2
rage lunge solar rays lunge,2
alright come on three two one,2
pretend like you're pushing something that's invisible into the ground switch lower down slow four three two one like matrix-style like you're like pushing something away from you but you can't see it,2
roll your shoulders back,2
you're feeling you're ready for this weight,2
lower is not necessarily better on these,2
come on all the way out all the way out the enemy's come in three two one,2
four good breathe two more last one,2
you're just going to alternate your knees,2
press off that heel good you look great last one good right into jump rope so your feet are just going to go side to side arms right by your side circling like you would a jump rope and you want to again,2
this one's under control so that means we're not swinging up and flinging them back down right,2
make sure you're on a flat surface and that your mat doesn't slip,2
now i want you to try to extend the opposite leg when you're here,2
get this key moving,2
what warm-up would be complete without ten reps of jumping jacks,2
keep that chest up,2
we only got two more guys,2
then squat down or you can start in a quarter squat and move laterally and do a full squat,2
i mean into it as much as you need you to feel stretch,2
come on squad alright,2
if you were doing low impact before you can spice it up by lifting your hands upwards like so [music] people say i try too hard,2
punch star is 20 seconds of each of them back-to-back so 20 seconds of marching fast or running 27 two punches and 20 seconds and ease and 20 seconds,2
four three two one and reset okay,2
it's the touch and knee raise coming to the left,2
we're starting off for swiss foot jumps plus a squats,2
big inhale big exhale,2
so your muscles stay contracted the entire time,2
this is about that point in the workout,2
i can feel it angie and then weights all right bye,2
i'm already feeling it breaking the sweat,2
big exhale all the way up fully,2
work it through dig core strong,2
deep breaths engage work through,2
how does it feel,2
let's go the active recoveries and making this level 4 work out the official rating is 3,2
now we're gonna go into that reverse motion for ten total reps next up,2
your legs are gonna feel like they're gonna fall but i promise they're gonna be there the whole time,2
we're going to go to the ground for the next one,2
our way hands out in front core tight and we open up,2
that was fun so now we're going back to those fast feet,2
forty seconds here,2
that's fine otherwise,2
all right,2
we can always keep those knees bent and of course without spilling the plant three rounds,2
i'm loving this,2
squeeze your butt push your top of your your feet to the ground,2
you're stronger than the pain,2
[music] bring one leg diagonally behind you as you lunge down then push off from your front heel to get back up and repeat on the other leg,2
20 seconds left 10 seconds to 1 all right so next up we are doing two knee,2
crunch shuffle to your left then crunch and squeeze your abs,2
i'm so excited right now because the ground is hot you got to pick up your feet and then we're going to cool it down four high knees,2
