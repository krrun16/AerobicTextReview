hey guys it's Kelly from Fitness Blender
dot com and today I have a body weight only
cardio workout for you we're going to be
doing 45 seconds on with 15 seconds reps
and then A B A B format I've included
your warmup and your cooldown so let's
go ahead and get started alright so
we've got a built-in warmup we're gonna
start off with that 45 on 15 seconds
rest structure but we're going to start
nice and light so that we like I said we
have a built-in warmup so go ahead and
get your feet moving we're gonna start
off with sidestep jacks so nice and
light start on one side just step out
and so you're doing the motion of a
jumping jack with your arms but you're
just kind of tapping lightly from side
to side instead of jumping so
increasingly these intervals are gonna
get sweatier and sweatier his first
little bunch is quite easy
while our muscles are warming up after
that it's gonna turn into a sweat best
hopefully we're halfway good start to
pick up the speed as you get comfortable
as you start to throw your body warm up
ten seconds five
all right so 15 seconds rest remember to
always keep your feet moving never want
to be still doing this so at least a
boxer shuffle you can always make it
harder if you need to we're doing those
kind of forces you to get a good stretch
to all the way down lower yourself up
squeeze your glutes push back up so if
you're not very flexible you can always
come here
bend your knees until you can get to the
floor your hamstrings are tight ten
seconds left five seconds
all right now we're going back to that
second round of those sidestep jacks
so keep your feet moving for a little
arm work in there as well for that
warm-up two one here we go just side to
side enjoy the easy stuff won't last
make sure you're sitting up nice and
tall to make you good posture while
you're doing these exercises make sure
you're not doing kind of half
half-hearted jumping jack motion keep
your arms straight try to move slower if
you have to and get the full range of
motion instead of doing a quick no not
full effort version 10 seconds left to
one all right get this key moving
putting down into those walk down back
bows five seconds two one here we go
I know I use variation of walk downs and
my routines often because I love them
they feel good but they work so
many different muscles there's a lot of
different ways you can modify them
about 20 seconds left
10 seconds to 1 all right so next up we
are doing two knee pulls so we're still
and that low-impact lower-intensity
warmup period but we're going to start
picking up here after this so again if
this is too easy step up the intensity
of your rest otherwise here we are so
we're one two one two so this is nice
and low impact if you want to step it up
mm-hmm
just add in some jumps you can always
make things easier or harder as you need
to
otherwise we just hear all about what
works for you go over halfway done try
to get a little crunch
flex your core while you're doing this
is definitely an abs exercise as well as
a cardio exercise about five seconds
left
all right next up we're doing a lunge
plus a rotation
five seconds left here we go so we drop
down into that lunge rotate rotate in
the center we just come back up so your
legs are probably can you start burning
we are holding that lunge you're also
working your core about halfway already
if you're not feeling very warmed up yet
or if you're new to exercise you can
just keep your lunge nice and shallow
and just kind of step forward instead of
a really deep lunge but if you want to
make it harder sink down into it I'm
here here center two one all right
fifteen seconds rest so if you're not
sweating at all you know we're several
minutes and at this point we're quite
good ways in so you can start to really
step up those intensities of both the
intervals and your rest periods all
right - knee pulls so like I said the
harder version start jumping around and
you can always mix it - so if you're
here and you start to get winded well
your motions start to get sloppy take
it back down and honestly the
combination of both is a really great
way to make pretty much any routine you
work for yourself and to improve your
fitness really well because you can
always alter it modify it and push
yourself when you need to and then lay
back when off in intensity a little bit
but you're not stopping just five
seconds left
all right so we're doing that lunge
with rotation like I said even more bit
challenge step up your best best
intervals two one here we go sit down
turn to each side come back up so after
this point of the routine now that
you're nice and warmed up you can also
make it quite a lot harder by adding
weight so holding onto weights while you
do this kind of stuff makes it a lot
more difficult got about 20 seconds left
ten five right next up we're doing two
jumping jacks plus a lateral jump here
so this is one of those exercises to
make you feel a little bit uncoordinated
but that's the whole point
I'm teaching your brain to pay attention
to what you're moving so two jumping
jacks plus from the center do your jobs
here so you'll notice I'm doing my first
lateral jump on a different side each
time you're going to want to do the same
so if I jump last here you jump right
first the next time I'm going to get
more comfortable sky to jump further and
further on each side to one my right
next up yeah push it up Plus reach Oh
drop down your match is about 105
seconds left
here we got us up do the harder version
push up they can tap your foot behind
you come back down do another pushup
turn the other way so not only are you
getting all all the benefits of the
push-ups there are tons there's hardly
any muscles you're not working during
push-up also getting extra butt work the
extra of core work because of that
rotation is just a few minutes away from
one great
five seconds all right jump back up
those lateral jumps plus jacks always
remember make that the rest as hard as
you need to you can do burpees if you
want be my guest - jumping jacks
- make sure you're not holding your back
remember it's always okay if
you're really struggling take an extra
break quick drink of water you can come
right back into it just don't walk away
from it three two one rest take some
deep breaths you can start doing
push-ups right now if you want to take
out that I'm older I started up pushup
keep your core pulled in try to keep
your spine aligned move back left about
half way got about ten seconds left to
run okay so here's your water break keep
your feet moving
don't go away too far and start right
back in in just a minute
alright we're ready to tackle the second
half of this routine we're doing the
same thing we're starting off for Swiss
foot jumps plus a squats okay go ahead
get your feet moving
we'll be doing some fun cardio here so
one two three four drop down first
drop in the middle one two so try to leave a
different foot each time so make sure
you're sinking down keep your back flat
for that squat keep your weight in heels
try to land soft on your feet for those
jumps about five seconds left
alright next up we have plank jack lifts
so this did you know a soft surface
but actually I'm using my feet so your
toes otherwise you're here take your leg
up as high as you can he's the other leg
up as high as you can no three jacks
repeat this time leading with the
different leg squeeze those gluts try to
pull in your core again you're working
your entire letting this
five to one right back to those flutter
kicks or those switch foot jumps with the
spots remember make that the rest as
hard as you need you three two one here
we go so one two three four down take a
break me too
three two one alright check down the mat
for doing those plank jacks again so do
it this way so you can see what my legs
are doing back here five seconds left
here we go two jacks lift next up we're doing
a lunge plus a bow ten seconds rest
here
down top here up back up switch feet
down over halfway right here seven
seconds two one all right drop down to
the floor you'll be doing side hip
raises so I'm going to start out on my
right side the next roll on my left so
whichever way you do it remember so you
don't end up ignoring on your side two
one here we go
all right so up it's rising up three we
hit do you want to make this harder you
can go on your toes just like this
otherwise stand on your knees just crunch
upwards
try to keep this elbow joint right
underneath your shoulder turn that this
slide she feeling this in this hip when
this outside thigh as long as this thigh
and of course your knees
about five seconds left
all right
jump up can you do those weird bows
again there's one's about
alright so hands over head lunge forward
I'm down to the floor come back up start
it over on the other side
about ten seconds left
all right so remember which side you're
on last time go ahead and lay down on
the opposite side doing those hip raises
again and then after this thing we have
one more group left before I pull down
you go up I keep it nice and steady
never really rest on the ground you're
only hovering here so your muscles stay
contracted the entire time
that's halfway
10 seconds left 3 2 1
right next up we're doing the supine
plank reach so this one's kind of fun
we're gonna start on one side I'm going
to start with this leg straighten out
so the resting point of this motion is
tucking your hand in right here and then
we're gonna press up so we get a lot of
glute work on each side stretch before
you tuck that down again you're not
resting here you'll be hovering before
you push back up so you should feel it
in your thighs your upper body your
glutes and your lower back try to use
really smooth movements about 15 second
flush
right next up we have squats plus side lifts
so then do a lift on each side in
between their squat here we go
squat there we go well actually we'll
just do one sorry I lied so squat and
then come right back up with your weight
in that leg so you're actually doing a
lot more work each time on one of your
legs so it's a good way to build
strength and balance and if you need to
you can hold on to something while you
do this but if you're not it definitely
takes a lot of core work honestly
something like this is a million times
better for your abs than any kind of
crunch you could ever think of ten
seconds left so whichever leg you had
extended last time is coming in oh yeah
sorry to do opposite leg position so
we're tacking it on this side this time
here we go so we press the up come back
down I remember not to let your body the
rocks look around completely remember to
keep breathing it's really easy to hold
your breath here
squeeze the top two one all right when
it relaxed we've got 15 seconds and then
one more active interval then a
cool-down and you'll get your workout
complete for the day to keep moving from
our squat plus I like this here we go so
down lift up I'm trying to make this as
controlled as you can you don't want to
be just throwing it up there you don't
use monitoring you and control the
entire time no cheating
it's tempting right just about 20
seconds left
five seconds all right that does it for
your cardio I'm gonna bring our heart
rate down and stretch out those muscles
so keep your feet moving for a second
just some nice deep breaths here all
right
clean your feet nice and slow stretch
overhead stretch as far as you can for
the entire way it all the way the top
now lean to one side ever so slightly
gently as far as you can no the other
more time on each side
next we're gonna swing down and then
it's circle towards one of our toes so
slowly stretching the entire way down to
one toe then walk slowly over to the
other I'll come back up so whatever your
range of motion is you have to respect
it and never push it stretch to where it
hurts
move nice and slow always no bouncing to
try to get more range of motion just
doodle you can do that once more so you
should feel this in your lower back and
the back to your thighs now go down once
more opposite direction
alright now were to go into a warrior on
one side so one foot pointed forward
when perpendicular arms out I mean into
it as much as you need you to feel
stretch
take a couple nice deep breaths here and
tip forward so rest your arm on your
thigh arm straight up stay here for a
couple breaths
alright now fold forward and rotate your
deep runners lunge go down as far as you
need to to get a good stretch feel this
in your groin here blows through these
aside slowly up straighten that leg but
keep reaching for that toe now you're
gonna feel this through the back of this
side that's straight now come back up
same thing on the opposite side so point
this what's for this one in line with
your hands lean forward as much as you
need to you to get a good stretch
right now tilt forward straight in here
open your chest up a nice stretch
going forward over this foot that deep
lunge
and straighten that way which is
breaching for that toe
all right you know come back up we stretch out the
front of those thighs
quadriceps so you need to hold
onto the wall for balance that's fine
otherwise pull your foot up as far as
you need to get a stretch to the front
of your thigh
switch sides
all right now if you've got an open wall
or anything to rest your hand against we're
gonna do a chest stretch so place your
hand against the wall straighten your
arm and then slowly rotate away until
you feel stretch all through here
you know make sure you drink lots of
water after this just lost a lot of
water through our workout we need to
rehydrate as soon as you can alright
switch sides so opposite hand rotate
away you feel a good stretch
right now let's walk down into a plank
nice and slow I'm doing that stretch and
you're way up there now you're gonna
stay here and kind of walk so put your
weight in one leg lift the other off the
ground so you're pressing your heels
down towards the mat as much as you can
to try to get a good cat stretch
and switch keep it a nice fluid movement
just hold it for a few seconds each
all right oh come down this away deliver
yourself to that man put your feet over
