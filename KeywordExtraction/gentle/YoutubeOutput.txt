[music] well today was significantly better than yesterday in terms of the plane situation at least today we filmed over eight pages which is actually a significant amount of screen time we start off with this really really beautiful scene one of the most beautiful scenes we've done in terms of the meaning of it now unfortunately i don't have much footage for you to show because it was all in this small tent and so our behind the scenes team couldn't get in there during any other rehearsals or during any of the filming but it's this really really beautiful scene between jesus mary magdalene and mother mary i think it's going to end up being one of the more impactful scenes of the show so since she's she's going to kind of come to him near the end there she did that in that take and i think that feels good so feel free to do this whatever you want okay i felt like it seemed like you were kind of wanting to but we're waiting till the end and it's it's okay to comfort her or to put your hand on her if you feel that if you feel that instinct then we were out on outside the tents in the campsites and we had two long scenes one between thomas and andrew which is joey and noah and one between big james and john which is abe and george you know i've talked a lot about the tension that's building with the disciples and how they're trying to figure each other out figure out who's in charge of what this is where you see some of these private conversations as they're dealing with each other talking about each other um in fact dealing especially with one of their newcomers what's this guy about what's he doing you know he seems to be doing some weird exercises each morning that they're not used to so all these different personalities coming together and so not only do we occasionally see some arguments as the tension rises but we also sometimes get a glimpse at some of these private conversations and so you see them gossiping a little bit talking about each other complaining about each other what if what if you said i wonder how mary's doing so you have you have your paws you don't have anything to say which is fine we we we play out that moment of just kind of quiet i wonder how mary's doing i think poor mary is too too too sharp left of a turn i think if i if we say that i wonder how mary is doing it preempts the fact that i cannot i can understand why she would feel doubt because i don't always know what's going on you know yeah we start to see this group become uh like what maybe you haven't seen in other bible projects but they they really feel like us they feel like what we would be like if we got in a group and had to try to learn each other and learn how to follow jesus and learn how to change our entire life with another group of people that we didn't know before and people who are much different than we are and that's what this season is about and that's what today was about as well so hopefully prayerfully the rest of this week goes like today did and hopefully the rest of the shoot goes like today did because it'll make me feel quite a lot better sometimes you get the shadow on his face yeah i won't do that i won't do that just keep an eye on it yeah yeah there was one there was one moment where you were standing there was this like perfect outline that but just skewed enough that it just looked like this decrepit old man it was weird hey there i'm dallas i'm the creator of the chosen and if you haven't seen season one or if you want to see season two you gotta get the chosen app it's free it's easy you don't even need a subscription go check it out
