breathe get that energy back in focus with crisp movements good form it's all about keeping up it's about doing it right we're gonna go over to the other side in three two one here we go so the opposite side now really important that core engaged although impact everything we do here we will start is one low-impact and two standing so you could be confident that you can be involved in the work out the whole way through that's different than saying you have to do every single moment but you can be doing it with us feeling this now already three two one i'm loving this feel the energy from these guys deep breaths hydrate water if you need it looking good their way the next exercise is gonna be a shoulder rage lunge solar rays lunge i finally got that which is going to be scared three two one here we go so the pace is high go slow or you can go past it is called real star plus in case you're already a little bit upset with us for the speed and the intensity but this is about taking your body on that bit further feel good wherever you are if you need to break halfway through it's about progress not perfection do your best march whenever you have to be strong three two and one and a nice march next one is a touch and me raise okay and we're gonna touch and raise into the right knee so fast pace keep marching if you have to three two one here we go so we touch one knee forty seconds here you're gonna find that that build up is intense through the planted leg not the one that you're raising right come on guys let's work this it's about desire the physical body can do

work wait loving that extra effort i can feel it angie and then weights all right bye so don't envy you we got straight punches three two one i practiced this workout the other day i've got about 20 seconds in with weights and i thought i'll give them to angie because i can do that tough enough as it is in that core strong to get them punches out powerfully your best punches punch someone there's

while and stretch out right leg first with the quad core tight nice deep breaths and then change over to the other side [music] breathe in deep i am honestly still struggling to get my breath back that's how it's feeling like a nice stretch through the quads low-impact i'll say again all standing that was a body changing change juice filled workout core strong and as long as you're here stretching with us whether you press pause 20 times whether you did half of each section or 10 percent of each section it doesn't matter because you can come back tomorrow and do a little bit more if you marched through the whole session that's great never question yourself every moment that you move your body is a step towards the outcomes that you want it's not gonna be dramatic change comes because of consistent decisions and the day is a workout but darling however you did with it it is damn it is the win and nobody can take that away from you now it's a win we've won it's over unless you're doing another workout and in that case i probably question your sanity but that's lifting up above i am certainly done for the day that's 100% and let's enjoy a nice hang over as we say
