we're just gonna take into a regular reverse lunge so stepping it back you can rest the knee on the ground we'll drive through the heel bring it back together shoulders are ,158.58,166.81
you can let that a knee just go a little past your toe you don't want to go too far forward so your heel comes up you just want to really drive through that front heel to bring yourself back to standing position we'll go two more each ,168.03,179.06

last one each ,182.05,183.05
all right now I want you to take your feet about hip width we'll take it to two different movement patterns here first we're taking it into a squat so sitting back driving the knees out then we'll ,184.93,194.32
and then bring it back up so I want you to feel the difference between these two movements with that squat you're bending those knees feeling it more in those quads and that hinge you should feel in the back of those ,194.98,207.279999
so sit it ,207.969999,208.759999
hinge it ,209.469999,210.37
huh Rosio so glad you were able to make it this ,211.02,214.76
we've been loving having you every single week at our ,215.279999,218.68
we've got a few more just like this ,219.21,220.71
so we will revisit this hinge later ,222.46,224.88
in a single leg ,226.87,228.24
whoo last ,229.17,229.93
all ,230.7,231.54
so warm up feeling good we're gonna go to a nice little core set to start we're gonna hit three different moves and we're going three times through I'll give ,232.199999,240.62
one version for the first round and then each round I'll add on a little progression so first up we're gonna bring those shoulder blades off the ground we lower our legs to the lowest point we can keep that Mahalo in our body you ready join me now 30 seconds here shoulder blades off the ,241.34,255.96
big inhales ,256.87,258.59000000000003
,259.23,259.39000000000004
yeah okay so with these if you feel like they're feeling pretty challenging for you you can even bend those knees a little bit shorten that lever or you can even bring the legs up a little bit higher but whatever you're doing try to keep that hollow in your belly keep a lot of tension shoulder blades off the ground get that scoop ,262.28,279.7
two one relax all right lay down now you can bend those ,280.21,284.73
the fingertips are just grazing the back of your heels here you're gonna peel your hips off the ,285.27,290.55999999999995
and then you're gonna dig one heel to the ground as you bring one knee to your chest and then switch it out join me if you haven't ,291.18,297.459999
use your hands on the ground to give you some stability give you a little ,298.03,302.149999
because you want to keep the hips nice and stable as you're moving through these and really thinking about keeping the ribcage down and the tailbone tucked ,302.67,310.66
so ,311.17,311.92999999999995
yeah build that tension through the ,312.53,314.44

have had to really think ,969.91,971.279999
this time is changing things and looking at everything as an opportunity you know I'm used to going to the gym and lifting heavy things but what I've been loving is changing the ,971.93,980.24
going faster on some reps maybe slowing down some things some of the movements that I'm so used to picking up heavy weight I just use my body and challenge myself in such a different way and I look at it as a brand new opportunity so that's my new perspective for this week and for the past few ,981.4,996.47
last ,997.03,997.56
,999.48,999.9

remember you're breaking glass and you might notice one sides a little bit harder than the other and that's totally fine that's why I love doing single sided movements because it ,1510.01,1519.87
helps you recognize where your weaknesses are but not only that you're strengthening them like for me I hurt my right ankle a long time ago and this sides a little wobbly for ,1520.74,1529.89
