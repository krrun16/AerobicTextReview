let's bring ourselves ,899.43,900.12
we're going to a staggered stance squat now so before we're in a split squat almost like a ,901.09,906.11
now we're just going more of a staggered ,906.32,908.27
and just going down and up at a good ,908.55,910.29
join me now here we ,910.79,911.89
we're staying at the same ,912.25,913.8
we'll switch ,914.16,914.98
so go in a tempo that feels good for ,915.23,917.16
so ,917.719999,918.339999
my front toe or my back ,918.65,920.04
is in line with the back ,920.64,921.95
I'm focusing on driving my knees ,923.45,925.13
as I sit ,925.71,926.42
chest is ,927.389999,928.14
lower is not necessarily better on ,929.84,931.53
you should ,931.99,932.81
it more in that front leg but you definitely will feel it a little bit in that ,933.23,936.75
especially in that hip ,937.92,938.97
so keep it ,939.58,940.71
keep ,941.25,941.46
,941.85,941.91
you're doing ,942.62,943.42

alright few ,946.35,946.86
,947.8,947.96
,949.14,949.25
alright let's switch it up other side stagger the ,949.67,952.17
chest ,952.91,953.43
sit it ,954.059999,954.62
alright stay with me ,957.0,958.14
drive those knees ,959.01,960.08
go at ,961.03,961.55
tempo ,963.29,963.7
,964.98,965.19
,965.42,965.53
we've been thinking about new ,966.24,968.23
and what ,968.799999,969.35
have had to really think ,969.91,971.279999
this time ,971.93,972.55
changing things and looking at everything as an ,972.98,975.58
you know I'm used to going to the gym and lifting heavy ,975.96,978.36
but what I've been loving is changing the ,978.67,980.24
going faster on some reps maybe slowing down some ,981.4,984.25
some of the movements that I'm so used to picking up heavy ,984.53,986.96
I just use my body and challenge myself in such a different ,987.389999,990.32
and I look at it as a brand new ,990.549999,992.78
so that's my new perspective for this ,993.06,994.92
and for the past few ,995.25,996.47
last ,997.03,997.56
,999.48,999.9
now we're going into a ,1000.71,1002.14

the more stability you have ,1255.66,1256.849999
,1258.209999,1258.609999
so if you want to make it ,1260.389999,1261.94
easier you could bring your ,1262.48,1263.88
,1264.29,1264.74
,1265.05,1265.56
,1265.98,1266.21

I love this so ,2268.369999,2269.5
it's funny because this year was something was a year that I was like you know I really want to ,2269.74,2274.15
,2274.57,2275.02
Who I am and where I came from and I was actually born in the ,2275.83,2280.329999
,2280.69,2281.18
I came to the ,2281.759999,2282.859999
when I was only 2 years ,2283.059999,2284.4
so obviously didn't remember the ,2285.049999,2286.8
very ,2287.48,2288.12
and ,2288.45,2289.46
,2290.1,2290.44
for Christmas with my ,2290.9,2292.47
this past year for the first ,2292.75,2294.47
and it was just so amazing to be able to get cultural touch with my ,2294.8,2299.609999
but for me it's just really representing and being proud of everything that I do and always remembering where it came from ,2299.889999,2305.2
you know my mom is such a big representation of all of my hard ,2305.84,2309.34
,2309.75,2310.08
she's taught me everything and I really think it's ,2311.07,2313.729999
,2314.139999,2314.489999
came from the ,2314.7,2316.1
,2316.49,2316.96
I just like to be really proud of everything and I love Filipino ,2318.28,2321.77
,2322.01,2322.4500000000003
yeah I don't know if that really answers the question but yeah but ,2323.34,2327.2200000000003
