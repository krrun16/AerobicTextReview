PHRASE,START,END
hey everybody it's your personal trainer coach Kozak here from HASFIT And I'm Claudia and this is our beginner weight training routine this routine is great for both men and women of a beginner fitness level the only equipment required for this workout is a pair of dumbbells now that weight of the dumbbells is going to be totally determined by your current fitness level just remember it's much better to start light and work your way up than the other way around the only other equipment that you may want for this workout is a chair or a box for some of the modified movements we're going to do the whole thing with you ready to get this thing going all right we're going to start with either a dumbbell crusher or a dumbbell t row so if you want to do the easier modified versions you go and follow Claudia she's going to be using one dumbbell I'm going to use two ,0.01,51.29
that's the main difference I'm going to squeeze these together and I'm going to pull back and Claudia is just going to interlock her fingers and pull back either way we're both pulling back on our ,51.79,62.65
keeping those elbows tucked in nice and tight to the body pulling back we're keeping our core tight and straight and our upper body is on a 45 degree ,63.57,72.9
now we're not going to count any repetitions today I just want you to try to perform as many moves as you can in allotted time ,73.48,81.51
work at your own pace but at the same time be sure to push yourself because nobody else can do it for ,82.179999,87.75999900000001
,88.940001,89.410001
nice ,90.02,90.699999
keep it going pulling back on those elbows keeping them tight to your body in five four ,91.47,98.69
two and one okay we're going to go to the ground for the next one it's going to be a combo ,99.25,104.709999
we're going to need both weights for this ,105.75,107.99
we're going to do a hip up plus chest press we're going to drive off our heels and at the same time we're going to press the dumbbell straight up and back ,108.889999,117.75
getting a lot of ,118.29,119.809999
body parts worked in this one so we're getting your hamstrings your glutes your lower back your abs chest shoulders triceps the list goes on but it's a very efficient movement getting a lot of work in in a short period of ,120.639999,136.33999999999995
drive off those heels squeeze the gluts up at the top try your best not to hyperextend your back to just come up until your upper body is in this nice straight ,136.889999,146.11
and make sure not to bounce your arms off the ground ,146.74,149.51
nice work breathe one right into the ,150.17,154.53999900000002
moving at a pace that you feel comfortable ,155.099999,157.609999
you got ,158.73,159.33999999999995
almost ,160.74,161.45
let's go five more seconds on this ,162.77,165.04000000000002
and ,166.08,167.1
,167.65,168.21
,168.94,169.59
one and done okay we're on to our feet for the next ,170.23,174.67
need both weights ,175.719999,177.2
we're going to either do a stiff leg deadlift plus shrug or Claudia is going to show you an RDL which stands for Romanian deadlift I didn't make that ,177.98,186.24
plus ,186.76,187.62
either way we're going to put our weight back in our hips little bend the knee I'm going to go all the way down and I'm going to bring my hips forward and shrug Claudia's just going to come and bring her hands just below her knees and then repeat that same ,188.66,202.33
so ,202.87,203.21
driving our hips ,203.87,206.04
all the way up hips forward and then shrug bringing your shoulders up to your ,207.66,213.78
feel that stretch in your hamstrings if you're not feeling a stretch in the back of your leg then I want to make ,215.26,220.87
you are driving those hips ,222.1,223.96
just a little bend in those ,225.17,227.21
and hips go ,228.46,229.949999
again another combo ,230.639999,232.28
this one we are getting hamstrings glutes lower back and your ,233.119999,237.55
,238.05,238.52
and notice how both of us are keeping our backs nice and straight on this movement so we're ,239.26,244.02
breaking that straight line and hunching over but keeping our back straight while we're kicking those hips back you got ,244.719999,251.96
almost done with this one five four ,252.48,256.74
two and last one zero nice okay so we're going to move on to some shoulder presses next I'm gonna grab my box over here Claudia's going to grab her box and I'm going to do this one from a standing position so from the box it's a little easier standing a little harder standing it forces me to use a little bit more stability and a little bit more core but overall very comparable movements you decide which one is right for you if you don't feel comfortable the overhead quite yet grab a ,257.36,285.329999
full range of motion on this one all the way up all the way down stay nice and under control you don't want to fling or swing the dumbbells ,286.279999,295.48
keep your core ,296.25,297.38
this is a strength training routine so we don't want to I know you said work at your own pace but we definitely don't want to make this a cardio and just start pumping out correct exactly reps if you are using a weight that you can just do 100 reps in this 30 second time period then you need to up the ,297.92,314.28
nice okay not much time left on this ,315.09,317.699999
and five four three two and one nice all right shake those arms move this out of the ,319.69,327.64
and we're going to move into a dumbbell curl so we're gonna hit those biceps next working on the gun show Claudia's got a gun show with her tank top on tonight look at those ,328.16,336.16
,337.259999,337.589999
just admiring my wife's guns okay so we're going to do a ,339.009999,341.099999
both palms come up we're going to curl those pinkies in on the way up and then all the way back ,342.309999,347.48999999999995
again this one's under control so that means we're not swinging up and flinging them back down right that defeats the purpose but ,348.41,354.66
I feel that time under tension feel those muscles ,355.34,358.88
all the way up and all the way down you got it good Claudia's going to give you a nice side ,359.629999,365.06
keep those shoulders back and square mm ,366.13,369.62
you got it we're ,370.74,372.15
just 10 more seconds left on this ,372.95,374.84
fight ,375.46,376.35
you got ,377.35,378.11
and ,378.85,379.81
,380.53,381.13
one and zero alright moving to the lower ,381.69,385.68
Claudia is going to grab her box or if you have a chair that works as well if you want to do the modified version I'm also going to lose a dumbbell here yeah exactly she's only gonna use one weight good point so she's going to do a goblet squat you notice how she's holding the weight up with two hands and I got a my thumbs out I'm gonna do a dumbbell squat just at my side so I'm going to be able to get a little bit deeper than doing the chair or box squat but either way we're both bending at the hips first driving those hips ,386.36,414.09
and then coming ,414.609999,415.71
until our ,416.54,417.62
are parallel to the ,418.6,420.02
all the way up all the way ,420.6,422.27
and I'm just touching the ,423.29,424.76
and coming right back up I'm not sitting not ,425.62,428.92
,430.369999,430.949999
or bouncing that's the other thing right correct I'll give ,431.49,433.59
guys a side view ,435.23,436.49
squatting make sure you keep those knees out don't allow them to break or compress ,438.99,443.279999
nice work not much left on this one I know your legs are probably starting to feel it I didn't forget about you we got ,444.11,449.87
four three ,450.449999,453.169999
and one done ,453.96,455.6
we're going to move on to a ,456.18,457.53
tricep ,458.12,458.899999
we're gonna hit those triceps next save movement really just ,459.559999,463.36
mix up your weight find what weight works for you on this one so we're bent over our elbows are up we're only going to bend at those elbows not moving the whole ,464.12,474.21
keep your core ,474.75,475.89
and at the top you're squeezing that back of the arm squeezing your triceps up at the ,476.55,481.38
nice ,482.11,483.09
notice we're using that elbow as a ,484.209999,486.359999
so we're not moving that upper arm just bend at the elbow so what I mean by that is you're not going here right no swinging no swinging because now all of a sudden all the other muscles are taking over we just want to isolate the triceps on this ,487.07,499.7
you got it ten more seconds that's ,500.62,502.670001
guys are doing great thank you so much for joining us today and for all of your hard ,503.51,509.21
and ,509.93,510.67
,511.49,512.0
one and done ,512.57,514.249999
we're going to the ground losing my weights Claudia's going to lose her weights I'm going to keep mine though we're going to do a dumbbell reach ,515.139999,522.09
,522.59,523.0
from a crunch position we're going to our feet on the ground we're going to reach up to the ,523.56,527.8599999999999
we're bringing our shoulder blades off the ground and come back down so we ,528.4,531.9800000000001
contracting the ABS up at the top reaching up big and high you see I'm using my weights making it more difficult Claudia she's just using her body ,532.5500000000001,540.3499999999999
you could also just use one weight if you wanted to that's right so again it's all about making this your own coming back repeating it getting a little bit better every single ,541.89,553.64
and that's how we improve that ,554.34,557.1
nice work reaching ,558.44,559.67
don't bounce off the ground stay under control you got ,560.17,564.03
nice work nice ,564.71,566.18
we got 10 more seconds on this ,567.59,569.399999
feeling those ABS start to work that's a good ,570.11,573.6799990000001
that's the feeling of improvement right ,574.82,577.69
and ,578.57,579.4799999999999
,580.05,580.54
one and zero ,581.16,583.75
we're going to rest that's the end of the first round we got one more to ,584.309999,588.139999
all right so it's a quick 20 second break that doesn't give you much time if you want feel free to grab some water shake it loose take a couple deep breaths we're going to get right back into ,589.29,600.54
all right so we got ten seconds I'm going to grab my dumbbells we're getting ready we're starting with the ,601.57,606.85
we're gonna I'm doing my crusher row Claudia's doing her T ,607.41,610.980001
and here we go we're pulling back at those elbows keeping our core nice and tight and if you're wondering why we didn't take a longer break even though we're beginners that's because the workout specifically designed to allow some muscles to rest while others are working so right now our backs working but at the same time our chest may be resting allows us to get a lot done in a short period of time again pulling back on those elbows anytime you're doing a row you want it to be like you have a string attached to your elbows and you're just pulling back on it just be sure to keep that core tight also exactly you don't want your ,611.549999,647.7299989999999
getting loose or allowing your abs to ,648.3,651.87
almost there on this one let's go five four ,652.94,656.95
two and one all right going to the ,657.46,660.8000000000001
you need both weights for this next one doing that hip up plus chest ,661.849999,666.5100000000001
so we're driving off the ,668.07,669.89
and squeezing our glutes and pressing up at the ,670.44,673.92
,674.55,675.1099999999999
nice work and again on any of these don't feel like you have to use the same weight for all of them feel free to adjust the weight as you go through ,675.88,683.1999989999999
start with your best guesss ,685.04,686.57
don't just keep the weight if you're not able to complete the reps in a safe ,687.4,692.13
or the other way if it's not challenging you make sure to up the weight so you ,693.23,696.4300000000001
get that full ,697.429999,698.9599999999999
nice work driving off the heels pressing straight up keep it up guys almost ,700.389999,704.93
and five ,705.79,708.0699999999999
,708.67,709.36
two one zero we're up on our ,709.89,713.8399999999999
and try to keep the pace up a little bit faster for the second round because we know what we're doing we're going to stiff leg deadlift or RDL plus ,714.57,722.39
kick back right below your knees pop em and ,723.31,726.4499999999999
taking the weight back on our hips feeling that ,727.6999999999999,730.4
and up and ,731.52,733.5
nice work this one really hits that ,734.13,736.11
posterior chain so ,736.92,738.68
I always ,739.64,740.26
in your front are the show muscles in the back are the go muscles basically means all your power and real athleticism comes from your ,741.35,749.12
come on keep it up you got ,750.12,751.39
nice ,752.63,753.4499989999999

,762.16,762.8199999999999
,763.55,764.0999999999999
one and zero finishing strong okay grab your seat if you got one so if you're doing your shoulder press seated feel free to grab it otherwise kicking them up getting right into it bring those dumbbells down to about in line with your ears maybe just a little bit lower really depends on your flexibility and what feels ,764.74,784.8299999999999
don't take it to a place ,785.44,786.9
feels awkward with your ,787.57,789.26
nice work core stays tight doesn't matter either one whichever one you're doing still stays ,790.01,794.99
nice work this is about that point in the workout where you start to really feel it it starts to kick in and it becomes all mental right now not even physical it's all up in your head it's all that mental toughness and grip that's going to keep you moving and fighting through rep by Rep let's go ,795.88,813.05
on and ,813.5799999999999,815.0699999999999

moving on to a dumbbell curl so we're hitting the biceps next let's get it both curling at the same time curling those pinkies ,822.2,829.4499999999999
there we go arms are starting ,830.39,831.72
