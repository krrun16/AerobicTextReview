PHRASE,START,END
hey everybody it's your personal trainer coach Kozak here from HASFIT And I'm Claudia and this is our beginner weight training ,0.01,6.57
this routine is great for both men and women of a beginner fitness level the only equipment required for this ,6.79,13.24
is a pair of ,13.45,14.83
now ,15.04,15.53
weight of the dumbbells is going to be totally determined by your current fitness level just remember it's ,15.82,22.32
better to start light and work your way ,22.63,25.32
than the other way around ,25.54,27.28
only other equipment that you may want for this workout is a chair or a box for some of the modified ,27.55,33.739999000000005
we're going to do the whole thing with ,34.07,35.620000000000005
ready to get this thing going all right we're going to start with either a dumbbell ,36.0,40.67
,40.95,41.5
,41.88,42.24
dumbbell t row so if you want to do the easier modified versions you go and follow Claudia ,42.69,47.940000000000005
going to be using one dumbbell I'm going to use ,48.23,50.68
,50.92,51.29
that's the main difference I'm going to squeeze these together and I'm going to pull ,51.79,56.470000000000006
and Claudia is just going to interlock her fingers and pull back either way we're both pulling back on our ,56.87,62.65
keeping those elbows tucked in nice and tight to the body pulling back we're keeping our core tight and straight and our upper body is on a ,63.57,71.559999
degree ,71.799999,72.9
now we're not going to count any repetitions today I just want you to try to perform as many moves as you can in allotted time ,73.48,81.51
work at your own ,82.179999,83.62
but at the same time be sure to push yourself because nobody else can do it for ,83.969999,87.75999900000001
,88.940001,89.410001
nice ,90.02,90.699999
keep it going pulling back on those elbows keeping them tight to your ,91.47,95.03
in ,95.31,96.35
,96.81,97.61
,98.05,98.69
,99.25,99.98
and one okay we're going to go to the ground for the next one it's going to be a combo ,100.19,104.709999
we're going to need both weights for this ,105.75,107.99
we're going to do ,108.889999,109.54
hip ,109.77,110.5
plus chest press we're going to drive off our heels and at the same time we're going to press the dumbbell straight ,110.77,116.17
and back ,116.51,117.75
getting a lot of ,118.29,119.809999
body ,120.639999,121.71
worked in this one so we're getting your hamstrings your glutes your lower back your abs chest shoulders triceps the ,122.099999,129.71
goes ,130.15,131.24
but it's a very efficient ,131.55,133.5
getting a lot of work in in a short period of ,133.8,136.33999999999995
drive off those heels squeeze the gluts up at the ,136.889999,139.57
try your best not ,139.86,140.75999900000002
hyperextend your back to just come up until ,141.12,143.6
upper body is in this nice straight ,143.949999,146.11
and make sure not to bounce your arms off the ground ,146.74,149.51
nice ,150.17,150.95999999999998
,151.23999999999998,152.11999999999998
one right into the ,152.54,154.53999900000002
moving at a pace that you feel comfortable ,155.099999,157.609999
you got ,158.73,159.33999999999995
almost ,160.74,161.45
let's go five more seconds on this ,162.77,165.04000000000002
and ,166.08,167.1
,167.65,168.21
,168.94,169.59
one and done ,170.23,172.5
we're on to our feet for the next ,172.9,174.67
need both weights ,175.719999,177.2
we're going to either do a stiff leg ,177.98,180.119999
plus ,180.459999,181.25
or Claudia is going to show you an RDL which stands for Romanian deadlift I didn't make that ,181.47,186.24
,186.76,187.12
,187.58,187.62
either way we're going ,188.66,189.62
put our weight back in our hips little bend the knee I'm going to go all the way ,189.83,194.37
and I'm going to bring my hips forward and shrug Claudia's just going to ,194.66,197.799999
and bring her hands just below her ,198.01,200.14
and then repeat that same ,200.45,202.33
so ,202.87,203.21
driving our hips ,203.87,206.04
all the way up ,207.66,208.53
forward and then shrug bringing ,208.849999,211.519999
shoulders up to your ,211.929999,213.78
feel that stretch in your hamstrings if you're not feeling a stretch in the back of your ,215.26,219.67
then I want to make ,219.9,220.87
you are driving those hips ,222.1,223.96
just a little bend in those ,225.17,227.21
and hips go ,228.46,229.949999
again another combo ,230.639999,232.28
this one we are getting hamstrings glutes lower ,233.119999,235.54
and your ,235.99,237.55
,238.05,238.52
and notice how both of us are keeping ,239.26,241.04
backs nice and straight on this movement so we're ,241.32,244.02
breaking that straight line ,244.719999,246.629999
hunching over but keeping our back ,246.9,249.21
while we're kicking those hips back you got ,249.69,251.96
almost done with this ,252.48,253.62
,254.08,254.81
,255.23,255.9
,256.29,256.74
,257.36,257.87
and last ,258.27,259.56
zero nice ,259.97,261.17
so we're going to move on to some shoulder presses next I'm gonna grab my box over here Claudia's going to grab her box and I'm going to do this one from a standing position so from the box it's a little ,261.45,270.339999
,270.779999,271.469999
a little harder standing it forces me to use a little bit more stability and a little bit more ,271.67,277.06
but overall very comparable movements you decide which one is right for you if you don't feel ,277.36,282.7
the overhead quite ,282.99,284.21
grab a ,284.559999,285.329999
full range of motion on this ,286.279999,288.3
all the way up all the way down stay nice and under ,288.59,292.36
you don't want to fling or swing the dumbbells ,292.8,295.48
keep your core ,296.25,297.38
this is ,297.92,298.449999
strength training routine so we don't want ,298.74,301.14
I know you said work at your own pace but we definitely don't want ,301.49,304.23
make this a cardio and just start pumping out correct exactly reps if you are using a weight that you can just do 100 reps in this 30 second time period then you need to up the ,304.549999,314.28
nice okay not much time left on this ,315.09,317.699999
and ,319.69,320.63
,320.98,321.74
,322.01,322.5
two and one ,322.889999,325.02
all right shake ,325.38,326.06
arms move this out of the ,326.3,327.64
and we're going to move into a dumbbell curl so we're gonna hit those biceps next working on the gun show Claudia's got a gun show with her tank top on tonight look at those ,328.16,336.16
,337.259999,337.589999
just admiring my wife's guns okay so we're going to do a ,339.009999,341.099999
,342.309999,342.639999
palms come up we're going to curl those pinkies in on the way up and then all the way back ,342.98,347.48999999999995
again this one's under control so that means we're not swinging up and flinging them back down right that defeats the purpose but ,348.41,354.66
I feel that time under ,355.34,356.82
feel those muscles ,357.139999,358.88
all the way up and all the way down you got it good Claudia's going to give you ,359.629999,363.52
nice side ,363.9,365.06
keep ,366.13,366.68
shoulders back and ,366.94,368.809999
mm ,369.03,369.62
you got it we're ,370.74,372.15
just 10 more seconds left on this ,372.95,374.84
fight ,375.46,376.35
you got ,377.35,378.11
and ,378.85,379.81
,380.53,381.13
one and zero alright moving to the lower ,381.69,385.68
Claudia is going to grab her box or if you have a chair that works as well if you want to do the modified ,386.36,390.39
I'm also going to lose a dumbbell ,390.66,392.04
,392.32,392.56
exactly she's only gonna use one weight good ,392.929999,395.020001
so she's going to do ,395.23,396.11
goblet ,396.42,397.32
you notice how she's holding the weight up with two hands and ,397.63,400.52
got a my thumbs ,400.93,401.44
I'm gonna do a dumbbell squat just at my side so I'm going to be able to get a little bit ,401.71,407.089999
than doing the chair or box ,407.55,409.689999
but either way we're ,410.16,411.23
bending at the hips first driving those hips ,411.46,414.09
and then coming ,414.609999,415.71
until our ,416.54,417.62
are parallel to the ,418.6,420.02
all the way up all the way ,420.6,422.27
and I'm just touching the ,423.29,424.76
and coming right back up I'm not sitting not ,425.62,428.92
,430.369999,430.949999
or bouncing that's the other thing right correct I'll give ,431.49,433.59
guys a side view ,435.23,436.49
squatting make sure you keep those knees out don't allow ,438.99,441.3200000000001
to break or compress ,441.66,443.279999
nice work not much left on this one I know your legs are probably starting to feel it I didn't forget about ,444.11,448.749999
we got ,449.02,449.87
,450.449999,451.119999
,451.529999,452.159999
,452.619999,453.169999
and one done ,453.96,455.6
we're going to move on to a ,456.18,457.53
tricep ,458.12,458.899999
we're gonna hit those triceps ,459.559999,461.3
save ,461.639999,462.54
really just ,462.78,463.36
mix up your weight find what weight works for you on this one so we're bent over our elbows are ,464.12,469.05
we're only going to ,469.34,470.61
at those ,471.06,472.31
not moving the whole ,472.71,474.21
keep your core ,474.75,475.89
and at the top you're squeezing that back of the ,476.55,478.869999
squeezing your triceps up at the ,479.08,481.38
nice ,482.11,483.09
notice we're using that elbow as a ,484.209999,486.359999
so we're not moving that upper ,487.07,489.15
just bend at the elbow so what I mean by that is you're not going here ,489.44,492.38
no swinging no ,492.8,494.26
because now all of a sudden all the other muscles are taking over we ,494.599999,497.6
want to isolate the triceps on this ,497.9,499.7
you got ,500.62,501.32
ten more seconds that's ,501.53,502.670001
guys are doing great thank you so much for joining us ,503.51,506.53
and for all of your hard ,506.78,509.21
and ,509.93,510.67
,511.49,512.0
one and done ,512.57,514.249999
we're going to the ,515.139999,516.209999
losing my weights Claudia's going to lose her weights I'm going to keep mine ,516.44,519.48
we're going to do a dumbbell reach ,519.95,522.09
,522.59,523.0
from a crunch position we're going to our feet on the ,523.56,525.92
we're going to reach up to the ,526.26,527.8599999999999
we're bringing our shoulder blades off the ,528.4,530.07
and come back down so we ,530.46,531.9800000000001
contracting the ABS up at the top reaching up big and high you see I'm using my ,532.5500000000001,536.949999
making it more difficult Claudia she's just using her body ,537.27,540.3499999999999
you could also just use one weight if you wanted to that's ,541.89,544.6800000000001
so again it's all ,545.05,546.34
making this your ,546.83,548.0999999999999
coming ,548.59,549.419999
repeating it getting a little bit ,549.7099989999999,551.78
every single ,552.15,553.64
and that's how we improve that ,554.34,557.1
nice work reaching ,558.44,559.67
don't bounce off the ,560.17,561.5899999999999
stay under control you got ,561.85,564.03
nice work nice ,564.71,566.18
we got 10 more seconds on this ,567.59,569.399999
feeling those ABS start to work that's a good ,570.11,573.6799990000001
that's ,574.82,575.38
feeling of improvement right ,575.719999,577.69
and ,578.57,579.4799999999999
,580.05,580.54
,581.16,581.7099999999999
,582.0,582.53
zero ,582.82,583.75
we're going to rest that's the end of the first round we got one more to ,584.309999,588.139999
all right so it's a quick 20 second break that doesn't give you much ,589.29,592.969999
if you want feel free to grab some ,593.18,595.5699999999999
shake it loose take a couple deep ,595.84,598.2
we're going to get right back into ,598.46,600.54
all right so we got ten seconds I'm going to grab my dumbbells we're getting ready we're starting with the ,601.57,606.85
we're gonna I'm doing my ,607.41,608.649999
row ,608.94,609.3199989999999
doing her T ,609.73,610.980001
and here we go we're pulling back at those elbows keeping our core nice and ,611.549999,616.1899999999999
and if you're wondering why we didn't take a longer break even though we're ,616.66,620.5
that's because the workout specifically designed to allow some muscles to rest while others are working so right now our backs ,620.73,627.88
but at the same time our chest may ,628.119999,630.1799990000001
resting allows us to get a lot done in a short period of ,630.48,634.9599999999999
again pulling back on those ,635.44,637.59
anytime you're doing a row you want it to be like you have ,637.87,639.94
string ,640.16,641.38
to your elbows and you're just pulling back on ,641.759999,644.0899989999999
just be sure to keep that core tight also exactly you don't want your ,644.42,647.7299989999999
getting loose ,648.3,649.3
allowing your abs ,649.67,650.74
,650.99,651.87
almost there on this one let's go ,652.94,655.04
,655.44,656.08
,656.47,656.95
,657.46,657.99
and one all right going to the ,658.32,660.8000000000001
you need both weights for this next ,661.849999,663.84
doing that hip up plus chest ,664.139999,666.5100000000001
so we're ,668.07,668.5300000000001
off the ,668.79,669.89
and squeezing our ,670.44,672.02
and pressing up at the ,672.22,673.92
,674.55,675.1099999999999
nice work and again on any of these don't feel like you have to use the same weight for all of ,675.88,679.9300000000001
feel free to adjust the weight as you go through ,680.349999,683.1999989999999
start with your best guesss ,685.04,686.57
don't just keep the ,687.4,689.0699999999999
if you're not able to complete the reps in a safe ,689.34,692.13
or the other way if it's not challenging you make sure to up the weight so you ,693.23,696.4300000000001
get that full ,697.429999,698.9599999999999
nice work driving off the heels pressing straight ,700.389999,703.18
keep it up guys almost ,703.58,704.93
and ,705.79,707.1099999999999
,707.56,708.0699999999999
,708.67,709.36
,709.89,710.46
,710.91,711.49
zero we're up on our ,711.79,713.8399999999999
and try to keep the pace up a little bit faster for the second round because we know what we're ,714.57,718.3000000000001
we're going to stiff leg deadlift or ,718.66,720.9100010000001
plus ,721.23,722.39
,723.31,723.54
back right below your ,723.74,725.27
pop em and ,725.62,726.4499999999999
taking the weight back on our hips feeling that ,727.6999999999999,730.4
and up ,731.52,732.51
,732.77,733.5
nice work this one really hits that ,734.13,736.11
posterior ,736.92,737.37
so ,737.699999,738.68
I always ,739.64,740.26
in your ,741.35,742.0600000000001
are the show muscles in the back are the go ,742.32,744.67
basically means all your power and real athleticism comes ,744.92,747.869999
your ,748.11,749.12
come on keep it up you got ,750.12,751.39
nice ,752.63,753.4499989999999
not many ,754.549999,755.509999
let's ,755.74,756.23
five more seconds that's ,758.14,759.3499999999999
and ,760.6,761.47
,762.16,762.8199999999999
,763.55,764.0999999999999
one and zero finishing strong ,764.74,767.86
grab your seat if you got ,768.09,769.349999
