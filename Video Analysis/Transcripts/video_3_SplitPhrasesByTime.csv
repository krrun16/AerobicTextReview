I practiced this workout the other ,420.27,422.24
I've got about 20 seconds in with weights ,423.15,425.08
I thought I'll give them to ,425.67,427.14
I don't think I can do ,428.43,430.0
not ready for ,430.629999,431.28
it's tough enough as it ,432.73,434.43
,435.62,435.67

20 times whether you did half of each section or 10 percent of each section it doesn't matter because you can come back tomorrow and do a little bit more if you marched through the whole session that's great never question yourself every moment that you move your body is a step towards the outcome that you ,1662.73,1685.49
