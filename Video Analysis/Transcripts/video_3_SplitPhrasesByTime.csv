for the speed,316.83,317.56
and the intensity,318.33,319.13999900000005
but this is about taking your body on that bit further,320.08,322.459999

wherever you are,324.299999,325.32

the planted leg,371.12999900000005,372.449999

I've got about,423.15,423.42
20 seconds in with weights and,423.73,425.08
I thought,425.67,425.71
I'll give them to Angie,426.19,427.14
I don't think I can do that,428.43,430.0
not ready for that,430.629999,431.28
it's,432.73,432.77
tough enough as it is,433.15,434.43
keep,435.62,435.67
that core strong,436.71,437.61
get them punches out powerfully,438.4,439.95

as always at body project,444.36,445.66
you can punch anyone you like,445.88,447.34
except Angie,447.91,448.789999
me,449.190001,449.570001
or Wade that's off limits,449.91,451.589999
as much as you might want to three,452.91,454.48
two,455.38000000000005,455.5100000000001
and one,456.93,457.68

two,478.099999,478.549999
one,479.219999,479.719999
so we come we lift the left knee now,480.41,482.369999
keep,483.029999,483.339999
that core strong you can slow right down,486.07,488.22
if you just want to put some squats in for a second as well,488.6,491.29
that's fine you can kind of stand to,491.77,493.88
like this,494.34,495.059999
I might have lost everybody there,495.929999,497.26
but it's important to show you some different,498.28,499.709999
variations,500.429999,501.609999
working through,502.289999,503.019999
remember this workout is designed to be tough,504.47,506.89
please,507.56,508.46
press pause,508.79,509.74
whenever you have to,510.16,511.35
take an extra break,512.09,513.44
whenever you need to,513.91,515.07
and,516.759999,517.539999
march,517.94,518.33

fortunately,522.699999,523.709999
we've got a little bit of time off cardio now,524.239999,526.5899999999999
that's the good news,527.43,528.33
the bad news is,529.03,530.08
we've got some more tough work,530.52,532.4100000000001
on the legs,532.77,533.64
with some sidestep,534.0,534.34
resistance in three,534.96,536.4
two,537.059999,537.3199989999999

to keep stepping up,561.79,562.54
keep working on its,562.96,564.01
here to find the place that you can get to,566.45,569.0699989999999
working through,570.809999,571.779999
three,573.46,573.94
two,574.92,575.4399999999999

ANGIE,588.809999,590.559999

two,596.92,597.16
one here we go,597.8,598.78
so I like a little arm movement remember the lower you go,599.82,602.78
the tougher it is,603.28,604.5
if you feel a twinge in your lower back,604.91,606.9599999999999
just stop immediately,607.52,609.19
pushing through,610.9,611.7700000000001

the knee and,667.4,668.0400000000001
the bum it's called the hamstring,668.32,669.87
and we throw a punch out,670.2,671.62
you can put a little dip in there as well,672.14,674.04

keep marching keep moving,1573.37,1575.06
little side steps now,1576.61,1578.16
that,1580.559999,1580.909999
is what I call,1581.52,1582.4099990000002
a kick off workout,1583.690001,1584.9299999999998
I just figured,1585.59,1586.62
if you're gonna be here of filming,1587.37,1588.84
we might as well go in at the deep end right,1589.24,1591.02
we might as well just go in and get it done how good,1591.58,1594.74
does it feel now how good do you feel,1595.42,1597.37
having done that session today,1597.889999,1599.29
little open up at the arms,1600.309999,1601.43
we're gonna start our stretch we'll just let that heart rate come down,1602.83,1605.6699999999998
it takes a little while,1606.15,1607.31
and stretch out,1608.92,1609.91
right leg first,1610.559999,1611.51
with the quad,1611.84,1612.5
core tight,1613.11,1614.0
nice deep,1616.599999,1617.099999
breaths,1622.939999,1623.099999
and,1625.259999,1625.379999
then change over to the other side,1625.769999,1627.1699999999998
breathe in deep I am honestly still struggling to get my breath back,1635.96,1638.85
that's how it's feeling like a nice stretch through the quads,1639.82,1642.5
low impact I'll say again,1644.3,1646.22
all standing,1646.69,1647.91
that,1648.139999,1648.589999
was,1649.01,1649.6
a body changing change juice filled workout,1650.099999,1653.02
core strong,1654.99,1655.799999
and as long as you're here stretching with us whether you press pause,1657.5,1662.02
20 times whether you did half of each section,1662.73,1665.46
or 10 percent of each section,1665.73,1667.39
it doesn't matter,1667.62,1668.79
because you can come back tomorrow,1669.02,1670.58
and do a little bit more,1670.79,1672.0600000000002
if you marched,1672.43,1673.51
through the whole session,1673.779999,1675.0
that's great,1675.35,1676.3300000000002
never question yourself every moment that you move your body,1676.72,1681.08
is a step,1681.32,1682.23
towards,1682.5,1683.24
the outcome,1683.5,1684.37
that you want,1684.599999,1685.49
it's not gonna be dramatic,1686.09,1688.009999
change comes,1688.309999,1689.57
because of consistent decisions and the day is a workout but done,1689.799999,1694.8
however you did with it it is done it is the win,1695.53,1698.7
and nobody can take that away from you now,1698.94,1701.06
it's a win we've won,1701.42,1702.88
