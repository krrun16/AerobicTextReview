work out the whole ,258.64,260.19
,260.57,260.94
that's different than saying you have to do every single ,262.29,265.20000000000005
but you can be doing it with ,265.75,267.489999

,370.149999,370.6699990000001
the planted ,371.12999900000005,372.449999
not the one that you're raising ,372.849999,374.53
come on ,376.5,377.209999
let's work ,378.24,379.0
it's about ,380.2,381.2
the physical body can do so much it's in the ,381.87,385.22

if you need ,405.429999,406.31
good work ,406.91,407.88000000000005
loving that extra effort ,408.429999,409.519999
can feel ,410.309999,410.92
,411.63,412.23

I've got ,423.15,423.42
20 seconds in with weights ,423.73,425.08
I ,425.67,425.71
I'll give them to ,426.19,427.14
I don't think I can do ,428.43,430.0
not ready for ,430.629999,431.28
,432.73,432.77
tough enough as it ,433.15,434.43
,435.62,435.67
that core ,436.71,437.61
get them punches out ,438.4,439.95
your best ,440.99,442.109999
punch ,443.07,443.8
as always at body ,444.36,445.66
you can punch anyone you ,445.88,447.34
except ,447.91,448.789999
,449.190001,449.570001
or Wade that's off ,449.91,451.589999
as much as you might want to ,452.91,454.48
,455.38000000000005,455.5100000000001
and ,456.93,457.68
march it ,459.26,460.16
deep ,462.639999,463.489999
deep ,464.34,464.889999

,478.099999,478.549999
,479.219999,479.719999
so we come we lift the left knee ,480.41,482.369999
,483.029999,483.339999
that core strong you can slow right ,486.07,488.22
if you just want to put some squats in for a second as ,488.6,491.29
that's fine you can kind of stand ,491.77,493.88
like ,494.34,495.059999
I might have lost everybody ,495.929999,497.26
but it's important to show you some ,498.28,499.709999
,500.429999,501.609999
working ,502.289999,503.019999
remember this workout is designed to be ,504.47,506.89
,507.56,508.46
press ,508.79,509.74
whenever you have ,510.16,511.35
take an extra ,512.09,513.44
whenever you need ,513.91,515.07
,516.759999,517.539999
,517.94,518.33
and ,519.08,519.63
,522.699999,523.709999
we've got a little bit of time off cardio ,524.239999,526.5899999999999
that's the good ,527.43,528.33
the bad news ,529.03,530.08
we've got some more tough ,530.52,532.4100000000001
on the ,532.77,533.64
with some ,534.0,534.34
resistance in ,534.96,536.4
,537.059999,537.3199989999999

it's like an ,559.46,560.5500000000001
you ,560.97,561.23
to keep stepping ,561.79,562.54

a kick off ,1583.690001,1584.9299999999998
I just ,1585.59,1586.62
if you're gonna be here of ,1587.37,1588.84
