PHRASE,START,END
hey,14.219999,14.389999
guys it's Kelly from Fitness Blender dot com and today I have a body weight only cardio workout for you,16.879999,18.89
we're going to be doing 45 seconds on with 15,19.13,20.99
seconds reps and then A B A B format,21.44,23.82
I've included your warmup and your cooldown so let's go ahead and get started,24.06,27.42
alright so we've got a built in warmup we're gonna start off with that 45 on 15 seconds rest,28.66,34.149999
structure,34.659999,35.169999000000004
but we're going to start nice and light so that we,35.480000000000004,37.43
like I said we have a built in warmup so go ahead and get your feet moving we're gonna start off with sidestep jacks so nice and light start on one side just step,37.81,42.46
out,46.8,47.13
and so you're doing,47.41,48.1
the motion of a jumping jack with your arms but you're just kind of tapping lightly,48.48,51.74
from side to side instead of jumping,52.049999,53.77000099999999
so increasingly these intervals are gonna get,57.120001,59.49
sweatier and,60.06,60.900000000000006
sweatier his first little bunch is quite,61.73,63.549999
easy while our muscles are warming up,63.94,65.98
after that it's gonna turn into a sweat best hopefully,66.44,68.80999899999999
we're halfway,70.4,71.23
good start to pick up the speed as you get comfortable as you start to throw your body warm up,74.74000000000001,78.5
ten seconds,80.48,81.0
five,86.299999,87.009999
all right so 15 seconds rest,90.489999,92.18
remember to always keep your feet moving,92.6,94.35
never want to be still doing this so,96.61,98.16
at least a boxer shuffle you can always make it harder if you need to we're doing those,98.44,101.7
kind of forces you to get a good stretch to all the way down,116.009999,118.749999
lower yourself,122.17,123.35
up squeeze your glutes,124.23,125.789999
push back up,126.82,127.45
so if you're not very flexible you can always come here,128.67,131.38
bend your knees until you can get to the floor,131.79,133.95
your hamstrings are tight,134.91,136.509999
ten seconds left,140.37,141.17
five seconds,145.78,146.67
all right,150.94,151.43
now we're going back to that second round,152.32,153.98
of those,154.23,154.94
sidestep jacks so keep your feet moving,155.66,157.86
for a little arm work in there as well for that warm up,158.87,161.33999999999995
two,163.95,164.35
one here we go,164.98,165.92
just side to side,166.59,167.67000000000002
enjoy the easy stuff won't last,169.26,170.95
make sure you're sitting up nice and tall,178.57999999999998,180.04999999999998
to make you good posture while you're doing these exercises,181.139999,183.57
make sure you're not,186.27,186.97
doing kind of half,188.15,189.34
half hearted jumping jack motion keep your arms straight,189.809999,192.349999
try to move slower if you have to,192.69,194.579999
and get the full range of motion instead of doing a quick,195.33,197.839999
no,198.83,199.11
not full effort version,199.51,200.95
10,201.91,201.92
seconds left,202.22,202.77
to,209.01,209.41000000000005
one all right get this key moving,209.75,212.26
putting down into those,213.58,214.66
walk down,215.33,215.84
back bows,216.22,216.47
five seconds,221.16,221.89
two,223.96,224.39
one,224.809999,225.299999
here we go,225.849999,226.38
I know I use,235.21,235.95
variation of walk downs and my routines often because I love them,236.44,239.72
they feel good but they work so many different muscles,240.61,243.18
there's a lot of different ways you can modify them,244.42,246.319999
about 20 seconds left 10 seconds to 1 all,246.669999,248.94
right so next up,271.069999,271.98
we are doing,272.19,272.78000000000003
two knee pulls so we're still,273.02,274.56
and that low impact lower intensity warmup period but we're going to start picking up here,275.01,279.61
after this so,280.27,281.08
again,281.38,281.74
if this is too easy step up the intensity of your rest,282.219999,284.97
otherwise,285.94,286.49
here we are so we're,286.799999,287.58999900000003
one,288.07,288.43
two,288.65,288.79
one,289.34,289.73
two so this is nice and low impact if,290.26,292.09
you want to step it up mm hmm,292.5,293.94
just,294.29,294.59000000000003
add in some jumps you can always make things easier,295.85,299.159999
or harder as you need to,299.679999,300.799999
otherwise,304.209999,304.699999
we just hear,305.309999,305.919999
all about what works for you,306.96999900000003,308.23
go over halfway done,309.85,310.75
try to get a little crunch,315.139999,316.5
flex your core while you're doing this is definitely an abs exercise,317.0,320.56
as well as a cardio exercise,321.63,323.14999900000004
about five seconds left,325.41,326.61
all,329.68999999999994,329.71
right next up we're doing a lunge plus a rotation,331.80999999999995,334.24
five seconds,340.75,341.34
left,341.56,342.04
here we go so we drop down into that lunge,345.1,347.21
rotate,347.57,348.24
rotate,348.85,349.47
in the center we just come back up,349.81,351.27999900000003
so your legs are probably,352.13,353.38000000000005
can you start burning,353.69,354.879999
we are holding that,355.53,356.49999899999995
lunge,357.29,357.85
you're also working your core,358.58,359.86
about halfway already if,370.25,371.55
you're not feeling very warmed up yet or if you're new to exercise,372.15,375.45
you can just keep your lunge nice and shallow and just kind of step forward,375.92,379.46
instead of a really deep lunge,380.78,382.35
but if you want to make it harder,382.58,383.78
sink down into it,384.74,385.64
I'm here,385.92,386.53
here,387.08,387.53
center,387.96,388.38
two,389.58,389.77
one all right fifteen seconds rest,390.23,393.63
so if you're not sweating at all,395.02,396.44
you know we're several minutes and at this point,396.81,398.49
we're quite good ways in so you can start to really step up those intensities,399.12,402.64
of both the intervals and your rest periods all,403.76,405.73
right,406.969999,407.219999
knee pulls,407.469999,408.17
so like I said the harder version,409.7,411.1
start,412.23,412.45
jumping around,412.67,413.59
and you can always mix it,416.89,417.9
so if you're here and you,418.22,419.26
start to get winded,419.51,420.41
well your motions start to get sloppy,420.99,422.62
take it back down,422.98,423.85
and,424.139999,424.569999
honestly,425.66,426.2600000000001
the combination of both is a really,427.15,428.72
great way to make pretty much any routine you work for yourself and,429.28,432.67
to improve your fitness really well because you can always,433.129999,435.62
alter it modify it and push yourself when you need to and then lay back,436.09,439.85
when off in intensity a little bit but you're not stopping,440.8,442.98
just five seconds left,445.88,446.99
all right,451.29,451.7
so we're doing that,452.08,452.72
lunge with rotation,453.21,454.39
like I said,455.71,456.41
even more bit challenge step up,458.32,459.509999
your best best intervals,459.839999,462.19
two,464.44,464.86
one,465.309999,465.779999
here we go sit down,466.5,468.11
turn to each side,469.299999,470.36
come back up,470.72,471.48
so after this point of the routine now that you're nice and warmed up,474.68,477.359999
you can also make it quite a lot harder by adding weight so,478.77,481.079999
holding onto weights while you do this kind of stuff makes it a lot more difficult,482.25,485.1999990000001
got about 20 seconds left,490.99999900000006,492.32
ten,503.06,503.5
five,507.159999,507.699999
right,511.789999,511.989999
next up we're doing two jumping jacks plus a lateral,512.929999,515.37
jump here,517.69,517.9
so this is one of those exercises to make you feel a little bit uncoordinated but that's the whole point,520.049999,524.38
I'm teaching your brain to pay attention to what you're moving so,525.76,528.0699999999999
two jumping jacks plus,528.39,529.7099999999999
from,530.76,530.79
the center,531.51,531.96
do your jobs,532.5300000000001,532.95
here,534.63,535.11
so you'll notice I'm doing,535.62,536.97
my first lateral jump on a different side each time you're going to want to do the same,537.69,541.54
so if I jump,549.94,550.52
last here,550.75,551.45
you jump right first the,552.59,554.1
next time I'm going to get more comfortable sky to jump further and further on each side,557.0400000000001,568.76
to,569.8,570.14
one,570.7,571.0500000000001
my right next up,571.99,573.1
yeah,573.33,573.8000000000001
push it up Plus reach,574.379999,575.569999
Oh,575.940001,576.250001
drop down your,576.95,577.5
match is about 105 seconds left,578.43,583.53
here we got us up do the harder version push up they can,585.94,589.3100000000001
tap your foot behind you,590.509999,591.409999
come back down,591.849999,592.4899999999999
do another,593.4599999999999,593.7599999999999
pushup,594.1,594.11
turn the other way,595.4,596.0600000000001
so,596.34,596.7
not only are you getting all all the benefits of the push ups there are,597.76,600.5100000000001
tons,600.8800000000001,601.3900000000001
there's hardly any muscles you're not working during push up,602.0000000000001,604.42
also getting,605.37,606.0
extra butt work,607.799999,608.829999
the extra of core work,609.2799990000001,610.1800000000001
because of that rotation,610.73,611.75
is just a few minutes away from one great,616.66,618.18
five,625.99,626.28
seconds,626.5899999999999,626.85
all right,632.38,632.6999999999999
jump back,633.3,633.72
up those,635.78,636.25
lateral jumps plus jacks,636.46,637.69
always remember,639.66,640.34

one,1086.25,1086.78
here we go all right so up it's rising up three we hit,1087.39,1091.0099999999998
do you,1091.4599999999998,1091.4999999999998
want to make this harder,1092.58,1093.509999
you can go,1093.9,1094.63
on your toes,1095.349999,1096.0
just,1096.67,1096.71
like,1097.24,1097.42
this otherwise,1101.07,1101.57
stand on your knees just,1101.88,1103.03
crunch upwards,1106.21,1107.24
try to keep this elbow joint right underneath your shoulder,1110.49,1113.56
turn that this slide,1114.25,1115.21
she feeling this in this hip,1118.28,1120.06
when this outside thigh as long as this thigh,1120.71,1123.2
and of course,1123.55,1124.19
your knees,1125.11,1125.679999
about five seconds left,1127.05,1128.34
all right,1133.2099999999998,1133.36
jump up,1133.609999,1134.12
can you do those,1135.189999,1136.0700000000002
weird bows again,1136.41,1137.5500000000002
there's one's about,1137.97,1138.77
alright,1142.21,1142.31
so hands over head,1146.759999,1147.64
lunge forward,1148.509999,1149.24
I'm down to the floor,1149.799999,1151.04
come back up,1151.51,1152.21
start it over on the other side,1153.13,1154.5300000000002
about ten seconds left all,1181.59,1182.64
right so remember which side you're on last time,1192.5699989999998,1195.04
go ahead and lay down on the opposite side,1196.01,1197.5
doing those hip raises again,1198.91,1200.22
and then after this thing we have,1202.58,1203.64
one more group left before I pull down,1204.129999,1205.8200000000002
you go,1207.62,1208.0400000000002
up,1209.7600000000002,1210.14
I keep it nice and steady never really rest on the ground you're only hovering here so your muscles stay contracted the entire,1211.4800000000002,1216.8100000000002
time,1224.9600000000005,1224.9900000000002
that's halfway,1231.47,1232.25
10,1237.52,1237.7
seconds left,1242.95,1243.51
3 2 1 right next up we're doing,1249.83,1253.47
the,1254.31,1254.33
supine plank reach so,1254.799999,1256.01
this one's kind of fun we're gonna start on one side I'm going to start with this leg straighten out,1256.839999,1260.569999
so,1261.03,1261.43
the resting point of this motion,1261.64,1262.92
is tucking your hand in right here,1263.3,1264.63
and then we're gonna press up so we get,1265.05,1266.59
a lot of glute work on each side,1267.03,1268.88
stretch before you tuck that down again you're not resting here you'll be hovering,1269.599999,1273.149999
before you push back,1273.74,1275.13
up so,1275.8100000000002,1275.85
you should feel it in your thighs your upper body,1276.709999,1279.0
your glutes and your lower back,1279.51,1281.38
try to use really smooth movements,1288.94,1291.09
about 15 second flush,1298.52,1299.72
right,1312.959999,1313.3299989999998
next up we have squats,1314.119999,1315.48
plus side lifts,1316.3,1317.23
so,1318.5,1318.92
then do a lift on each side in between their squat,1320.44,1322.7799999999995
here we go,1327.37,1327.799999
squat,1328.139999,1328.769999
there we go,1329.54,1329.9599990000002
well actually we'll just do one sorry I lied,1330.26,1332.13
so squat and then come right back up,1332.5,1334.59
with your weight in that leg so you're actually doing a lot more work each time,1334.92,1338.3000000000002
on one of your legs so it's a good way to build strength,1338.68,1341.15
and balance,1341.7,1342.49
and if you need to you can hold on to something while you do this but if you're not,1343.67,1346.6
it definitely takes a lot of core work,1346.849999,1348.73
honestly something like this is,1349.35,1351.06
a million times better for your abs than any kind of crunch you could ever think of,1351.51,1355.94
ten seconds left,1363.54,1364.379999
so,1374.41,1374.77
whichever leg you had extended last time,1375.32,1377.37
is coming in,1378.32,1379.0
oh,1380.799999,1380.879999
yeah sorry to do opposite leg position,1381.17,1383.19
so we're tacking it on this side this time,1383.929999,1385.76
here we go so we press the up,1387.22,1388.68
come back down,1389.76,1390.4599999999998
I remember not to let your,1391.93,1393.29
body the rocks look around completely,1393.53,1395.25
remember to keep breathing it's really easy to hold your,1401.67,1403.8100009999998
breath,1404.250001,1404.5600009999998
here,1413.15,1413.5700000000002
squeeze the,1415.44,1416.26
top,1423.26,1423.33
two one all right when it relaxed we've got 15 seconds,1431.069999,1435.55
and then one more active interval,1436.36,1437.95
then a cool down and you'll get your workout complete for the day,1439.049999,1442.25
to keep moving,1443.78,1444.43
from our squat plus,1445.6,1446.65
I like this,1447.13,1447.42
here we go,1448.52,1448.809999
so down,1449.04,1449.73
lift up I'm trying to make this as controlled as you can,1450.51,1453.599999
you don't want to be just,1453.969999,1454.88
throwing it up there,1455.339999,1456.24
you don't use monitoring you and control the entire time,1456.6,1459.26
no cheating,1459.98,1460.57
it's tempting,1462.59,1463.2
right just about 20 seconds left,1471.12,1473.9499999999998
five seconds,1487.41,1488.3

right,1493.48,1493.95
that does it,1494.44,1495.039999
for your cardio,1495.799999,1496.56
I'm gonna bring our heart rate down,1496.86,1498.11
and stretch out those muscles,1499.06,1500.25
so,1500.72,1501.06
keep your feet moving for a second,1502.139999,1503.5800000000002
just some nice deep breaths here,1504.96,1506.39

slowly,1551.66,1552.59
stretching the entire way down to one toe,1553.71,1556.52
then walk slowly over to the other,1557.27,1559.69
I'll come back up,1562.87,1563.6
so whatever your range of motion is you have to respect it and never push it stretch to where it hurts,1565.469999,1570.0600000000002
move nice and slow always,1570.78,1572.5800000000002
