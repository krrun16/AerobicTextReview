then we'll hinge,193.28,194.32
and then bring it back up so I want you to feel the difference between these two movements,194.98,198.88
with that squat you're bending those knees feeling it more in those quads,199.21,202.67

in a single leg position,226.87,228.24
whoo last one,229.17,229.93

we're gonna go to a nice little core set to start we're gonna hit three different moves,234.039999,237.85
and we're going three times through,238.08,239.76
I'll give you,240.03,240.62
one version for the first round and then each round I'll add on a little progression,241.34,245.349999
so first up we're gonna bring those shoulder blades off the ground,245.61,248.199999
we lower our legs to the lowest point we can keep that Mahalo in our body,248.4,251.81

exhales,259.23,259.39000000000004
yeah okay so with these if you feel like they're feeling pretty challenging for you you can even bend those knees a little bit,262.28,268.489999
shorten that lever or you can even bring the legs up a little bit higher,268.84,271.81
but whatever you're doing try to keep that hollow,272.11,274.03
in your belly,274.35,275.14

grazing the back of your heels here you're gonna peel your hips off the ground,287.15,290.55999999999995
and then you're gonna dig one heel to the ground as you bring one knee to your chest,291.18,294.4
and then switch it out join me if you haven't already,294.79,297.459999
use your,298.03,298.36999999999995
hands on the ground to give you some stability,298.65,300.87
give you a little leverage,301.11,302.149999

let's bring ourselves up,899.43,900.12
we're going to a staggered stance squat now so before we're in a split squat almost like a lunge,901.09,906.11
now we're just going more of a staggered position,906.32,908.27
and just going down and up at a good tempo,908.55,910.29
join me now here we go,910.79,911.89
we're staying at the same side,912.25,913.8
we'll switch sides,914.16,914.98
so go in a tempo that feels good for you,915.23,917.16
so notice,917.719999,918.339999
my front toe or my back toe,918.65,920.04
is in line with the back heel,920.64,921.95
I'm focusing on driving my knees out,923.45,925.13
as I sit back,925.71,926.42
chest is up,927.389999,928.14
lower is not necessarily better on these,929.84,931.53
you should feel,931.99,932.81
it more in that front leg but you definitely will feel it a little bit in that back,933.23,936.75
especially in that hip flexor,937.92,938.97
so keep it straight,939.58,940.71

tempo so,963.29,963.7
this,964.98,965.19
week,965.42,965.53
we've been thinking about new perspectives,966.24,968.23
and what I,968.799999,969.35
have had to really think about,969.91,971.279999
this time is,971.93,972.55
changing things and looking at everything as an opportunity,972.98,975.58
you know I'm used to going to the gym and lifting heavy things,975.96,978.36
but what I've been loving is changing the tempos,978.67,980.24
going faster on some reps maybe slowing down some things,981.4,984.25
some of the movements that I'm so used to picking up heavy weight,984.53,986.96
I just use my body and challenge myself in such a different way,987.389999,990.32
and I look at it as a brand new opportunity,990.549999,992.78
so that's my new perspective for this week,993.06,994.92
and for the past few months,995.25,996.47
last one,997.03,997.56
okay,999.48,999.9

american woman and athlete,2265.98,2267.33
I love this so much,2268.369999,2269.5
it's funny because this year was something was a year that I was like you know I really want to embrace,2269.74,2274.15
being,2274.57,2275.02
Who I am and where I came from and I was actually born in the Philippines,2275.83,2280.329999
and,2280.69,2281.18
I came to the US,2281.759999,2282.859999
when I was only 2 years old,2283.059999,2284.4
so obviously didn't remember the Philippines,2285.049999,2286.8
very much,2287.48,2288.12
and I,2288.45,2289.46
went,2290.1,2290.44
for Christmas with my mom,2290.9,2292.47
this past year for the first time,2292.75,2294.47
and it was just so amazing to be able to get cultural touch with my culture,2294.8,2299.609999
but for me it's just really representing and being proud of everything that I do and always remembering where it came from because,2299.889999,2305.2
you know my mom is such a big representation of all of my hard work,2305.84,2309.34
and,2309.75,2310.08
she's taught me everything and I really think it's because,2311.07,2313.729999
we,2314.139999,2314.489999
came from the Philippines,2314.7,2316.1
and,2316.49,2316.96
I just like to be really proud of everything and I love Filipino food,2318.28,2321.77
and,2322.01,2322.4500000000003
yeah I don't know if that really answers the question but yeah but anyway,2323.34,2327.2200000000003
