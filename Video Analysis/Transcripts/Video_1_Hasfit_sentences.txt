hey everybody it's your personal trainer coach Kozak here from HASFIT. And I'm Claudia and this is our beginner weight training routine. This routine is great for both men and women of a beginner fitness level. The only equipment required for this workout is a pair of dumbbells. Now that weight of the dumbbells is going to be totally determined by your current fitness level. Just remember it's much better to start light and work your way up than the other way around. The only other equipment that you may want for this workout is a chair or a box for some of the modified movements we're going to do the whole thing with. You ready to get this thing going. All right we're going to start with either a dumbbell crusher or a dumbbell t-row. So if you want to do the easier modified versions you go and follow Claudia. She's going to be using one dumbbell. I'm going to use two so that's the main difference. I'm going to squeeze these together and I'm going to pull back and Claudia is just going to interlock her fingers and pull back. Either way we're both pulling back on our elbows keeping those elbows tucked in nice and tight to the body pulling back. We're keeping our core tight and straight and our upper body is on a 45 degree angle. Now we're not going to count any repetitions today. I just want you to try to perform as many moves as you can in allotted time period. Work at your own pace but at the same time be sure to push yourself because nobody else can do it for you. Breathe. Nice work. Keep it going, pulling back on those elbows, keeping them tight to your body in five four three two and one okay. We're going to go to the ground for the next one it's going to be a combo movement. We're going to need both weights for this one. We're going to do a hip up plus chest press. We're going to drive off our heels and at the same time we're going to press the dumbbell straight up and back down. Getting a lot of different body parts worked in this one so we're getting your hamstrings, your glutes, your lower back, your abs, chest, shoulders, triceps. The list goes on but it's a very efficient movement. Getting a lot of work in in a short period of time. Drive off those heels. Squeeze the gluts up at the top. Try your best not to hyperextend your back to just come up until your upper body is in this nice straight line and make sure not to bounce your arms off the ground either. Nice work. Breathe one right into the next moving at a pace that you feel comfortable with. You got it. Almost there let's go five more seconds on this one and four three two one and done okay. We're on to our feet for the next one. Need both weights. Again we're going to either do a stiff leg deadlift plus shrug or Claudia is going to show you an RDL which stands for Romanian deadlift. I didn't make that up plus shrug either way we're going to put our weight back in our hips. Little bend the knee. I'm going to go all the way down and I'm going to bring my hips forward and shrug. Claudia's just going to come and bring her hands just below her knees and then repeat that same shrug. So we're driving our hips backwards all the way up. Hips forward and then shrug bringing your shoulders up to your ears. Feel that stretch in your hamstrings. If you're not feeling a stretch in the back of your leg then I want to make sure you are driving those hips back. Just a little bend in those knees and hips go back again. Another combo movement. This one we are getting hamstrings, glutes, lower back, and your traps good and notice how both of us are keeping our backs nice and straight on this movement so we're not breaking that straight line and hunching over but keeping our back straight while we're kicking those hips back. You got it. Almost done with this one five four three two and last one zero. Nice okay so we're going to move on to some shoulder presses next. I'm gonna grab my box over here. Claudia's going to grab her box and I'm going to do this one from a standing position. So from the box it's a little easier standing a little harder standing. It forces me to use a little bit more stability and a little bit more core but overall very comparable movements. You decide which one is right for you if you don't feel comfortable the overhead quite yet grab a seat. Full range of motion on this one. All the way up all the way down. Stay nice and under control. You don't want to fling or swing the dumbbells around. Keep your core tight. This is a strength training routine so we don't want to I know you said work at your own pace but we definitely don't want to make this a cardio and just start pumping out correct exactly reps. If you are using a weight that you can just do 100 reps in this 30-second time period. Then you need to up the weight. Nice okay. Not much time left on this one and five four three two and one nice. All right shake those arms. Move this out of the way and we're going to move into a dumbbell curl. So we're gonna hit those biceps next working on the gun show. Claudia's got a gun show with her tank top on tonight. Look at those guns. Anyway just admiring my wife's guns. Okay so we're going to do a curl both palms come up. We're going to curl those pinkies in on the way up and then all the way back down again. This one's under control so that means we're not swinging up and flinging them back down right. That defeats the purpose but instead I feel that time under tension. Feel those muscles contracting all the way up and all the way down. You got it good. Claudia's going to give you a nice side view. Keep those shoulders back and square mm-hmm. You got it. We're breathing just 10 more seconds left on this one. Fight through you got it and three two one and zero. Alright moving to the lower body Claudia is going to grab her box or if you have a chair that works as well if you want to do the modified version. I'm also going to lose a dumbbell here. Yeah exactly she's only gonna use one weight. Good point so she's going to do a goblet squat. You notice how she's holding the weight up with two hands and I got a my thumbs out. I'm gonna do a dumbbell squat just at my side so I'm going to be able to get a little bit deeper than doing the chair or box squat but either way we're both bending at the hips first driving those hips back and then coming down until our hips are parallel to the ground. All the way up all the way down and I'm just touching the chair and coming right back up. I'm not sitting not resting exactly or bouncing that's the other thing. Right correct. I'll give you guys a side view here squatting. Make sure you keep those knees out. Don't allow them to break or compress in. Nice work not much left on this one. I know your legs are probably starting to feel it. I didn't forget about you. We got five four three two and one done. Okay we're going to move on to a dumbbell tricep kickback. We're gonna hit those triceps next. Save movement really just to mix up your weight. Find what weight works for you on this one so we're bent over our elbows are up. We're only going to bend at those elbows not moving the whole arm. Keep your core tight and at the top you're squeezing that back of the arm squeezing your triceps up at the top. Nice work. Notice we're using that elbow as a lever so we're not moving that upper arm just bend at the elbow. So what I mean by that is you're not going here right. No swinging no swinging because now all of a sudden all the other muscles are taking over. We just want to isolate the triceps on this one. You got it ten more seconds that's it. Guys are doing great. Thank you so much for joining us today and for all of your hard work and three two one and done. Okay we're going to the ground. Losing my weights. Claudia's going to lose her weights. I'm going to keep mine though we're going to do a dumbbell reach crunch so from a crunch position we're going to our feet on the ground. We're going to reach up to the ceiling. We're bringing our shoulder blades off the ground and come back down. So we are contracting the ABS up at the top reaching up big and high. You see I'm using my weights making it more difficult. Claudia she's just using her body weight. You could also just use one weight if you wanted to. That's right so again it's all about making this your own coming back. repeating it, getting a little bit better every single time and that's how we improve that consistency. Nice work reaching up. Don't bounce off the ground stay under control. You got it nice work nice work. We got 10 more seconds on this one. Feeling those ABS start to work. That's a good thing that's the feeling of improvement right there and three two one and zero. Okay we're going to rest. That's the end of the first round. We got one more to go. All right so it's a quick 20 second break that doesn't give you much time. If you want feel free to grab some water. Shake it loose. Take a couple deep breaths. We're going to get right back into it. All right so we got ten seconds. I'm going to grab my dumbbells. We're getting ready. We're starting with the row. We're gonna I'm doing my crusher row. Claudia's doing her T row and here we go. We're pulling back at those elbows keeping our core nice and tight and if you're wondering why we didn't take a longer break even though we're beginners that's because the workout specifically designed to allow some muscles to rest while others are working. So right now our backs working but at the same time our chest may be resting. Allows us to get a lot done in a short period of time. Again pulling back on those elbows anytime. You're doing a row you want it to be like you have a string attached to your elbows and you're just pulling back on it. Just be sure to keep that core tight also. Exactly you don't want your back getting loose or allowing your abs to relax. Almost there on this one let's go five four three two and one. All right going to the ground. You need both weights for this next one doing that hip up plus chest press so we're driving off the heels and squeezing our glutes and pressing up at the same time. Nice work and again on any of these don't feel like you have to use the same weight for all of them. Feel free to adjust the weight as you go through it. Start with your best guesss but don't just keep the weight if you're not able to complete the reps in a safe manner or the other way if it's not challenging you. Make sure to up the weight so you can get that full benefit. Nice work driving off the heels pressing straight up. Keep it up guys almost there and five four three two one zero. We're up on our feet and try to keep the pace up a little bit faster for the second round because we know what we're doing. We're going to stiff leg deadlift or RDL plus shrug kick back right below your knees pop em and shrug taking the weight back on our hips feeling that stretch and up and shrug. Nice work this one really hits that whole posterior chain so important I always say in your front are the show muscles in the back are the go muscles basically means all your power and real athleticism comes from your backside. Come on keep it up. You got it. Nice work. Not many left let's go five more seconds that's it and four three two one and zero finishing strong. Okay grab your seat if you got one so if you're doing your shoulder press seated feel free to grab it. Otherwise kicking them up getting right into it. Bring those dumbbells down to about in line with your ears maybe just a little bit lower. Really depends on your flexibility and what feels comfortable. Don't take it to a place it feels awkward with your shoulders. Nice work core stays tight. Doesn't matter either one whichever one you're doing still stays tight. Nice work this is about that point in the workout where you start to really feel it. It starts to kick in and it becomes all mental right now not even physical. It's all up in your head. It's all that mental toughness and grip that's going to keep you moving and fighting through rep by Rep. Let's go come on and five four three two one zero. Ahh all right feeling good. Moving on to a dumbbell curl so we're hitting the biceps next. Let's get it both curling at the same time curling those pinkies in. There we go. Arms are starting to get a little bit of lactic acid built up in them. Remember you don't have to listen to that. That's just a pain signal but the muscles got plenty left you got this. Come on. Driving through curl those pinkies in. Shoulders are back. Nice work one right into the next using good form not swinging the weights not getting a bunch of momentum involved. Almost there let's go five more seconds that's it and four three two one zero. All right all right we're moving on to either a dumbbell squat or a dumbbell goblet squat from the chair. I'll clean that name up later. Okay so we're going into our squats. Weights back on our hips making sure to break at the hips every time because if you don't what happens is you bend at the knees first and you end up here and then you're like oh man my knees hurt. Hips back then squat. That's the key. Keep those feet flat. Drive off the heels nice work you got it. Every squat you do you're going to get that much better at it. Nobody starts great at these. I promise you it's work putting in the work right here and you will see the results. I promise you come back repeat it get better that's what it's all about. Thank you so much for your hard work today. Nice work good we got it. Let's go five four three two one and done. Okay we're going back to the upper body. Remember I said while one body parts resting the others working so now we're going to the upper body dumbbell tricep kickbacks. Elbows are up. Only bend at those elbows. Extend and squeeze that back of the arm. Squeeze those triceps. Nice work guys come on keep it up. One into the next this is it. Right here we don't have much left we got what about up one more exercise one more after this one guys that's it. Fighting through it's all mental. Remember focus on your goals focus on what brought you here what motivates you and get there. Breathe let's go and five four three two one and done okay we're going to finish up with some ABS. It means we're going to the ground. I'm gonna keep one. Claudia's gonna keep one this time. Two hands on one she'll go and we're going to go right into those reach crunches reaching up to the ceiling. Squeeze in those ABS up at the top. You got it breathe. Remember this is it right here what are you saving it for. Don't save anything put it all out there right now. Right here right now let's go. Nice work nice work not much left. More than halfway done with this one already here we go. Rep by Rep getting closer to the end closer to that finish line almost there. Come on now in five four three two one zero. Nice work we are done
