sit with our feet in front of us like we're just chilling out like this,14
look at that speed and power,14
here we stand,14
I'm going to squeeze these together,14
you end up here,14
looking good their way,14
so we're gonna go here,14
when you're here if you feel good or you can just stay here,14
all the way out,14
as well that's fine you can kind of stand to like this,14
all the way all the way all the way out Angie all the way out,14
so everything stays here,14
we're going this way now,14
feeling this now already,15
so I have to give a shout-out to my girl so super Sam for creating today's amazing playlist,15
catch a sip ,15
so if you want to do the easier modified versions you go and follow Claudia,15
remember I said while one body parts resting the others working,15
Rosio so glad you were able to make it this week we've been loving having you every single week at our workouts,15
these are the super rep this is a great shoe for hiit,15
feeling good we've got this we've got this,15
Michelle asked so she's been doing it beginner workouts in the app and wondering what other workouts she could do to get stronger,15
I look at it as a brand new opportunity so that's my new perspective for this week and for the past few months,15
Chrissy how you feelin,15
not ready for that,15
"you know what I call it, I call that change juice",15
Angie's going high impact me and Wade we're going low,15
got a shout out to the most amazing women that I know in LA,15
it's ideal for new exercisers and people returning to exercise,15
that's different than saying you have to do every single moment,15
thank you so much for giving us the opportunity to serve you today,15
how good do you feel having done that session today,15
now it's a win we've won,15
almost fell over good thing I got my fireplace,15
so you gotta keep going mom ,15
I don't really think it's fair to have the word just anywhere near this workout to be honest,15
so that's why I love the strength train,15
I guess my girl Kirstie our girls Tracey Copeland is back with us she gave us a little dance a few weeks ago and now she's here in getting our strength on ,15
this routine is great for both men and women of a beginner fitness level,15
I'm loving this,15
i hope you enjoyed this 15 minute beginner cardio workout ,15
you can give me some some good old Kirstie Gotso hot sauce burpees whatever you want,15
I'll be honest I don't envy her one little bit,15
or 10 percent of each section it,15
you're why I work hard you taught me everything,15
but that's up to you,15
I'm so excited right now because the ground is hot,15
take a selfie ,15
we're gonna really show how we can do it,15
"right, that defeats the purpose",15
we're winners we're winning this is the halfway mark,15
real people real workouts real results,15
told you my girl kills it Filipinos,15
and they're here to show us how it's done,15
but this is about taking your body on that bit further feel good,15
change comes because of consistent decisions and the day is a workout but done,15
so right now is when you're gonna start to probably break a sweat if you haven't already ,15
I feel like a bit of a fibber,15
come here first-ever buddies project work out,15
how'd it go for you Angie,15
now if you want to waddle over to your computer and ask you a question type it up,15
I'll clean that name up later okay,15
breaking the sweat good this is gonna get you nice and toned lean and right into the shape shape of our life the best shape of our lives right ,15
I always say in your front are the show muscles in the back are the go muscles,15
that's why I love doing single sided movements,15
this is a cardio move ,15
whether you did half of each section,15
good work there Wade loving that bud,15
like thoroughbred horses we are running to it,15
believe you can because you can and you will,15
Shala I'm so glad you're working with me thank you so much for being here it's been so fun,15
and it features real body project members,15
i promise it's going to fly by ,15
low-impact I'll say again all standing,15
how about you Tracy I love when my fellow Nike master trainers hang out with me on the work outs,15
every moment that you move your body is a step towards the outcome that you want,15
it hurts yes it burns yes,15
Angie and Wade have both lost 60 pounds using body project workouts,15
doesn't mean you have to do the whole thing,15
they're gonna feel the waterfalls of progress washing over us haha,15
and I hope you feel the same,15
I am so dripping,15
so obviously didn't remember the Philippines very much,15
it is the win and nobody can take that away from you,15
I can feel it Angie and them weights all right,15

the official rating is 3 I'm going to tell you now that's the trick into you pressing play,15
I'm coach Kozak I'm Claudia and we will see you at your next workout,15

It has amazing programs in there so don't forget to check it out,15
doesn't matter because you can come back tomorrow and do a little bit more,15

that's what matters that's what counts,15
you ready Michelle ,15
so you could be confident that you can be involved and work out the whole way through,15

feel the burn,15
I'm doing my crusher row Claudia's doing her T row,15
we have got some tough stuff coming today,15
I just use my body and challenge myself in such a different way,15
that is what I call a kick off workout,15
so this week we've been thinking about new perspectives and what I have had to really think about this time is changing things and looking at everything as an opportunity you know,15
hi be fitters I'm your coach today Allie Cohen,15
that was a body changing change juice filled workout,15
welcome to a real start plus,15
I know my girl Kirstie Gotso is was working out with us this morning you get to catch her next week again too,15
this second half we're gonna put in even more than the first half,15
if you'd like to take part in the rest of the real Start Plus plan with myself Angie and Wade come and join us at teen body project.com,15
I have designed this workout for you guys to enjoy moving,15
if you need to pull up to come back,15
I say a little you know they might over involve something that's called a burpee and everyone was like no,15
that's what gets you through the moments,15
I don't think Angie likes me as much as she did before,15
hey everybody it's your personal trainer coach Kozak here from HASFIT,15
you guys been hanging out with us working out really getting after it and being a really great example for everyone around you so thank you for that,15

shout out to my running mommies who have been tuning in finish my program recently now you're doing Kirstie's I love it,15
Oh Jake you've earned those waffles after this workout are they gonna have chocolate chips in them or bananas,15
it is like we've all been in the shower right,15
so today it was a perfect workout it even has this thing called the Burpee break that puts you in a really great position for the burpees that we were in,15
how we can roll our best effort,15
I know she's had her wake and drink coffee already this morning,15
I prefer chocolate chip banana pancakes,15
and we have Wade and Angie Mullins with us and they're here to show you how it's done,15
except Angie me or Wade that's off-limits as much as you might want to,15
get to working through,15
wherever you are if you need to break halfway through it's about progress not perfection,15
the real Start Plus plan takes us further than the real start plan,15
you ready Angie,15
at this point it's been really inspiring you guys are keeping me motivated so thank you for that,15
show me that game face,15
enjoy moving your body today,15
okay they're keeping you up keeping you strong,15
oh I love this question what does it mean to you to represent as an asian-american woman and athlete,15
so if you have any questions for me we're gonna answer them at the end of the chat cooldown,15
And I'm Claudia and this is our beginner weight training routine,15
that's a challenge but you guys have got to pick your place in there,15
I really think it's because we came from the Philippines and I just like to be really proud of everything and I love Filipino food,15
never question yourself,15
lifting up above I am certainly done for the day,15
well if you haven't already done my kick it off program which is a really great total body beginner strength program,15
basically means all your power and real athleticism comes from your backside,15
it's not gonna be dramatic,15
come back repeat it get better that's what it's all about,15
now we're not going to count any repetitions today,15
I've been loving everyone tuning in to all the workouts,15
and if you're wondering why we didn't take a longer break even though we're beginners that's because the workout specifically designed to allow some muscles to rest while others are working,15
can't tell you how excited we are to have these guys all the way over from Vermont USA,15
I'm giving you options remember this is your workout but we're doing it together,15

I went for Christmas with my mom this past year for the first time and it was just so amazing to be able to get cultural touch with my culture,15
