you didn't want us in this too much on you did ya ,15
how are you doing Angie good Angie,15
I love it so many different cities joining in a chat right now from all over the US and I know my toronto fam is here too,15
see all that took was a short amount of time to break that sweat,15
enjoying that march,15
all our impact everything we do here we will start is one low-impact and two standing,15
and I almost lost my bearings,15
this is another gear yet,15
I can't even talk,15
it's tough enough,15
I'm not so sure right now,15
but overall very comparable movements you decide which one is right for you ,15
I'll be honest I kind of make up a little bit of a lie to getting you in,15
that's how it's feeling,15
that's the good news,15
today's workout is a hundred percent low-impact,15
did you know protein can help muscle recovery after workout,15
go show you some motivation yeah I'd love to have you as a friend right,15
like for me I hurt my right ankle a long time ago and this sides a little wobbly for me,15
because it always helps you recognize where your weaknesses are but not only that you're strengthening them,15
and as long as you're here stretching with us,15
pause buttons there pause buttons your friend whenever you need to use it,15
I think it's getting hot in here should we sand it ,15
this circuit I want you to pretend like the groundâ€™s hot,15
the clock keeps ticking,15
I know your legs are probably starting to feel it I didn't forget about you,15
it's so awesome every single week,15
but there it is flowing through your body and changing your body,15
so all you need today is yourself and a little bit of space around you ,15
it's all winning every single moment that passes,15
my team kicks booty ,15
the physical body can do so much,15
who said you need high impact to get a fantastic heart raising super tough body changing life transforming workout,15
loving the energy guys,15
and I was actually born in the Philippines and I came to the US when I was only 2 years old,15
however you did with it it is done,15
