Where to classify

1. Phrases that are ambigious but refer to a 
	Phrase that was well described earlier

2. Guiding the user (i.e., "3, 2, 1, alright relax")

3. Optional additional challenges
	"If feeling good, try to do this"

4. Demonstrative pronouns - 
	(i.e., this, that, here, there, those)

5. !!! Talking about the  feeling the user should feel
		!!!


Concerns:
	What if it is just changing speed - (1)
		(i.e., Faster, slower, quick feet) 



Easy Classification - Descriptive

	All of them. 

2. Metaphors

3. user maximum ability (i.e., "as far as you can go")
