	Percentage of Instruction: 	<Actual Percentage of Instruction, Runs through percent_of_instruct.py with
						different dB thresholds. 


	Graphs				<Graphs of dB's of each video at different time increments>

Detecting heavy breathing as instruction or not: can manually detect in audacity, but not sure what the python 
	script will do. 

-- I think when an instructor uses a mic it detects a lot of breathes as instruction
