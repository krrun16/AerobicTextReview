water because we're really gonna get
after it today we're gonna start off
with our warmup
then we'll go with a little core then

bit then we'll take it to a strength set
then we'll start interweaving that
little agility set I got for you and
then boom we'll have a finisher then I'll
answer some of your questions then
we'll be done so let's just go ahead and
meet at the back of the mat here if you
have one big reach up nice and high
bend those knees and walk it out into a
high plank position rock forward and
back maybe on those wrists a little bit
maybe side to side and then walk your
hands back you can bend those knees a
little bit for a little more space big
reach up take it back down we're gonna
go through that a few times here so I
have to give a shout-out to my girl
so super Sam for creating today's
amazing playlist and she's also a fella
Filipina and we're celebrating Asian
Pacific American Heritage Month here at
Nike so we got to represent the Pinas
let's get a few more last one after this
big reach up maybe straighten out those
legs a little bit more
walk it out high plank let's go ahead
and take that foot outside of your hand
I want you to take the elbow down and
then open it up big reach try to reach
to the ceiling big spread through the
chest take it back down big
exhale all the way up fully extend that
leg back if you feel comfortable or you
can keep it on the ground we'll get two
more just like that big reach up and
then last one take it down
open it up alright let's place both
hands on the ground push yourself back
into that high plank let's take the
other foot outside you can rest that
knee or extend big reach up how fun is
it that we get to work out together all
of us every single week bringing you
live workouts from our living room

a great workout we've got two more just
like that
take it down big reach all right let's
go ahead and place the hand down we're gonna
bring it back to that high plank bend
those knees walk those hands back roll
yourself up nice and slow we're just
gonna take into a regular reverse lunge
so stepping it back you can rest the
knee on the ground we'll drive through
the heel bring it back together
shoulders are back you can let that and
you just go a little past your toe you
don't want to go too far forward so your
heel comes up you just want to really
drive through that front heel to bring
yourself back to standing position we'll
go two more each side make sure you're
breathing
last one each side all right now I want
you to take your feet about hip width we'll
take it to two different movement
patterns here first we're taking it into
a squat so sitting back driving the
knees out
then we'll hinge and then bring it back
up so I want you to feel the difference
between these two movements with that
squat you're bending those knees feeling
it more in those quads and that hinge
you should feel in the back of those
legs so sit it back hinge it forward huh
Rosio so glad you were able to make
it this week we've been loving having
you every single week at our workouts
we've got a few more just like this
squad
so we will revisit this hinge later on
in a single leg position whoo last one
all right
so warm up feeling good we're gonna go
to a nice little corset to start we're
gonna hit three different moves and
we're going three times through I'll
give you one version for the first round
and then each round I'll add on a little
progression so first up we're gonna
bring those shoulder blades off the
ground we lower our legs to the lowest
point we can keep that Mahalo in our
body
you ready join me now 30 seconds here
shoulder blades off the ground
big inhales and exhales yeah okay so with
these if you feel like they're feeling
pretty challenging for you you can even
bend those knees a little bit shorten
that lever or you can even bring the
legs up a little bit higher but whatever
you're doing try to keep that hollow in
your belly keep a lot of tension
shoulder blades off the ground get that
scoop three two one relax all right
lay down now you can bend those knees
the fingertips are just grazing the back
of your heels here you're gonna peel
your hips off the ground and then you're
gonna dig one heel to the ground as you
bring one knee to your chest and then
switch it out join me if you haven't
already use your hands on the ground to
give you some stability give you a
little leverage because you want to keep
the hips nice and stable as you're
moving through these and really thinking
about keeping the ribcage down and the
tailbone tucked up so breathe yeah build
that tension through the ground few more
here last one and one all right now
we're gonna bring ourselves into a bear
position so we'll swing it on around
knees underneath the hips
hands press into the ground we're gonna
hover those knees nice and easy off the
ground so look right past those
fingertips keep that tailbone tucked it
nice and strong so nice active shoulders
I want you to pretend like you're
pushing the ground away from you here
whoo big exhales and I know my girl
Kirstie Gotso is was working out with us

week again too - I know we've been loving
her work outs and her hot sauce burpees and

four three two one
alright switch it up other side keep
those hips squared forward down four
three two one we're going back to the
push-up set for this breathe control it
so these metrics are so great because
you can feel every single muscle in
your body you can make sure you're doing
the form right you're not just moving
through the motions you're actually
being really aware of your body right
two more just like this come on two one
reset last one let's go down four three two
one recover now we're going back to the
ground our push-ups we're changing it up
now we're going into a staggered stance
so we're gonna bring one arm down by our
armpit and one arm by our head so we're
gonna go here and then we'll switch join
me now let's get it so on these totally
fine to be on your knees do what form
that challenges you on these you got this
make sure you're breathing make sure
your body's in a straight line we
activated our core and our glutes a lot
so you want to make sure you're focusing
on keeping everything squeezed everything
active stay with me here hey it looks like
we have more than 1,500 people working
out with us today let's keep getting it
come on let's get one more that was fun
let's bring ourselves up we're going to
a staggered stance squat now so before
we're in a split squat almost like a
lunge now we're just going more of a
staggered position and just going down
and up at a good tempo join me now here
we go we're staying at the same side
we'll switch sides so go in a tempo that
feels good for you so notice my front
toe or my back toe is in line with the
back heel I'm focusing on driving my
knees out as I sit back chest is up
lower is not necessarily better on these
you should feel it more in that front
leg but you definitely will feel it a
little bit in that back especially in
that hip flexor so keep it straight keep
it forward you're doing great come on
squad alright few more two one
alright let's switch it up other side
stagger the foot chest up sit it
back alright stay with me here
drive those knees out go at your tempo
so this week we've been thinking about
new perspectives and what I have had
to really think about this time is
changing things and looking at
everything as an opportunity you know
I'm used to going to the gym and lifting
heavy things but what I've been loving
is changing the tempos going faster on
some reps maybe slowing down some things
some of the movements that I'm so used
to picking up heavy weight I just use my
body and challenge myself in such a
different way and I look at it as a
brand new opportunity so that's my new
perspective for this week and for the
past few months last one okay now we're
going into a narrow and wide push-up so
everything stays here and then
everything stays wide arms close arms
wide arms close arms wide alright you 
can be on your toes
for this or you be on your knees join me
now let's do it Oh Jake you've earned
those waffles after this workout are
they gonna have chocolate chips in them or
bananas I prefer chocolate chip banana
pancakes that's actually what I made
this morning for me and my partner I
haven't gotten to eat them yet though so
I've got a warm-up again so get a few
more began remember you can be on your
toes for these arms are wide arms are
narrow just build more in your triceps
when you go narrow yep everyone's doing
great
stay with me three two one those are hard
oh okay stand up now we're going narrow squat to
wide so feet go more narrow than those hips
sit in and then more of
a sumo and out join me now you haven't already
so step those feet out as wide as you
can and then get it out nice and narrow still
setting those hips back so in just a little
bit we're gonna speed this up and we're
gonna have an option to go plyo jumping
from in and out but when we speed it up
if you want to go plyo go for it
or if you are like I don't feel like jumpin 
and just move a
little faster okay you're with me all
right ten more seconds and then we'll
speed it up keep that chest up keep that
posture tall yes we're focusing on our
legs but you still want to think about
those back muscles to keep that nice
strong posture all right you ready to
speed it up here we go join me now
remember you can just speed it up or you
could give me two at each one going fast
all right you're with me this is the last
time on these squats join me come on
come on ten seconds nice and wide nice
and narrow five come on four three two one
that was fun so now we're going
back to those fast feet this time I'm
going to say side and when I say side

it back to center but we're gonna all
jump to your right

those elbows back and hold keep the hip
as level as you can you ready
join me now here we go up hold come on
switch drive those elbows back squeeze hold switch

stability you have switch yep so if you

a great holistic program with yoga
animal flow
strength and hiit so there are tons of
programs in there there's also a bunch
of regular workouts that aren't in
programs as well so check them out
alright go ahead and flip it over to the
other side same thing square yourself
forward
oh I love this question what does it
mean to you to represent as an
asian-american woman and athlete I love
this so much it's funny because this
year was something was a year that I was
like you know I really want to embrace
being Who I am and where I came from
and I was actually born in the
Philippines and I came to the US when I
was only 2 years old
so obviously didn't remember the
Philippines very much and I went for
Christmas with my mom this past year for
the first time and it was just so
amazing to be able to get cultural touch
with my culture but for me it's just
really representing and being proud of
everything that I do and always
remembering where it came from because
you know my mom is such a big
representation of all of my hard work
and she's taught me everything and I
really think it's because we came from
the Philippines and I just like to be
really proud of everything and I love
Filipino food and yeah I don't know if that
really answers the 
question but yeah but anyway thank you
everyone and thank you for asking that
question and happy Asian Pacific
American Heritage Month and thank you so
much for working out with us every
single week and playing inside and
playing for the world you are all so
amazing and so inspiring
I am Bettina Gozo and I will see you at
your next workout
