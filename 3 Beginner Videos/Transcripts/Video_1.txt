hey everybody it's your personal trainer
coach Kozak here from HASFIT. And I'm
Claudia and this is our beginner weight
training routine this routine is great
for both men and women of a beginner
fitness level the only equipment
required for this workout is a pair of
dumbbells
now that weight of the dumbbells is
going to be totally determined by your
current fitness level
just remember it's much better to start
light and work your way up than the
other way around the only other
equipment that you may want for this
workout is a chair or a box for some of
the modified movements we're going to do
the whole thing with you ready to get
this thing going all right we're going
to start with either a dumbbell crusher
or a dumbbell t-row so if you want to do
the easier modified versions you go and
follow Claudia she's going to be using
one dumbbell I'm going to use two so
that's the main difference I'm going to
squeeze these together and I'm going to
pull back and Claudia is just going to
interlock her fingers and pull back
either way we're both pulling back on
our elbows keeping those elbows tucked
in nice and tight to the body pulling
back we're keeping our core tight and
straight and our upper body is on a 45
degree angle now we're not going to
count any repetitions today I just want
you to try to perform as many moves as
you can in allotted time period work at
your own pace but at the same time be
sure to push yourself because nobody
else can do it for you breathe nice work
keep it going pulling back on those
elbows keeping them tight to your body
in five four three two and one okay
we're going to go to the ground for the
next one it's going to be a combo
movement we're going to need both
weights for this one we're going to do a
hip up plus chest press we're going to
drive off our heels and at the same time
we're going to press the dumbbell
straight up and back down getting a lot
of different body parts worked in this
one so we're getting your hamstrings
your glutes your lower back your abs
chest shoulders triceps the list goes on
but it's a very efficient movement
getting a lot of work in in a short
period of time drive off those heels
squeeze the gluts up at the top try your
best not to hyperextend your back to
just come up until your upper body is in
this nice straight line and make sure
not to bounce your arms off the ground
either nice work breathe one right into
the next moving at a pace that you feel
comfortable with you got it
almost there let's go five more seconds
on this one and four three two one and
done okay we're on to our feet for the
next one need both weights again we're
going to either do a stiff leg deadlift
plus shrug or Claudia is going to show
you an RDL which stands for Romanian
deadlift I didn't make that up
plus shrug either way we're going to put
our weight back in our hips little bend
the knee I'm going to go all the way
down and I'm going to bring my hips
forward and shrug Claudia's just going
to come and bring her hands just below
her knees and then repeat that same
shrug so we're driving our hips
backwards all the way up hips forward
and then shrug bringing your shoulders
up to your ears feel that stretch in
your hamstrings if you're not feeling a
stretch in the back of your leg then I
want to make sure you are driving those
hips back just a little bend in those
knees and hips go back again another
combo movement this one we are getting
hamstrings gluts lower back and your
traps good and notice how both of us are
keeping our backs nice and straight on
this movement so we're not breaking that
straight line and hunching over but
keeping our back straight while we're
kicking those hips back you got it
almost done with this one five four
three two and last one zero nice okay so
we're going to move on to some shoulder
presses next
I'm gonna grab my box over here
Claudia's going to grab her box and I'm
going to do this one from a standing
position so from the box it's a little
easier standing a little harder standing
it forces me to use a little bit more
stability and a little bit more core but
overall very comparable movements you
decide which one is right for you if you
don't feel comfortable the overhead
quite yet grab a seat
full range of motion on this one all the
way up all the way down stay nice and
under control
you don't want to fling or swing the dumbbells
around keep your core tight this is a
strength training routine so we don't
want to I know you said work at your own
pace but we definitely don't want to
make this a cardio and just start
pumping out correct exactly reps if you
using a weight that you can just do 100
reps in this 30-second time period then
you need to up the weight nice okay not much
time left on this one and five four
three two and one
nice all right shake those arms move this
out of the way and we're going to move
into a dumbbell curl so we're gonna hit
those biceps next working on the gun
show Claudia's got a gun show with her tank
top on tonight look at those guns anyway
just admiring my wife's guns okay so we're
going to do a curl both palms come up
we're going to curl those pinkies in on
the way up and then all the way back
down again this one's under control so
that means we're not swinging up and
flinging them back down right that defeats
the purpose but instead I feel that time
under tension feel those muscles
contracting all the way up and all the
way down you got it good Claudia's going to give
you a nice side view keep those
shoulders back and square mm-hmm you got
it we're breathing just 10 more seconds
left on this one fight through you got
it and three two one and zero alright moving
to the lower body Claudia is going to
grab her box or if you have a chair that
works as well if you want to the
modified version I'm also going to lose
a dumbbell here
yeah exactly she's only gonna use
one way good point so she's going to do
a goblet squat
you notice how she's holding the weight up
with two hands and I got a my thumbs out
I'm gonna do a dumbbell squat just
at my side so I'm going to be
able to get a little bit deeper then
doing the chair or box squat but either
way we're both bending at the hips first
driving those hips back and then coming
down until our hips are parallel to the
ground all the way up all the way down
and I'm just touching the chair and
coming right back up I'm not sitting not
resting exactly or bouncing that's the other thing right
correct I'll give you guys a side view here
squatting make sure you keep those knees
out don't allow them to break or
compress in nice work not much left on
this one I know your legs are probably
starting to feel it I didn't forget
about you we got five four three two and
one done okay we're going to move on to
a dumbbell tricep kickback we're gonna
hit those triceps next save movement
really just to mix up your weight
find what weight works for you on this
one so we're bent over our elbows are up
we're only going to bend at those elbows
not moving the whole arm keep your core
tight and at the top you're squeezing
that back of the arm
squeezing your triceps up at the top
nice work
notice we're using that elbow as a lever
so we're not moving that upper arm just
bend at the elbow so what I mean by that is
you're not going here right no swinging
no swinging because now all of a sudden
all the other muscles are taking over we
just want to isolate the triceps on this
one you got it ten more seconds that's
it guys are doing great
thank you so much for joining us today
and for all of your hard work and three
two one and done okay we're going to the
ground losing my weights Claudia's going to
lose her weights I'm going to keep mine
though we're going to do a dumbbell
reach crunch so from a crunch position
we're going to our feet on the ground
we're going to reach up to the ceiling
we're bringing our shoulder blades off the
ground
and come back down so we are contracting
the ABS up at the top reaching up big
and high you see I'm using my weights
making it more difficult Claudia she's
just using her body weight you could
also just use one weight if you wanted to
that's right so again it's all about making
this your own coming back repeating it
getting a little bit better every single
time and that's how we improve that
consistency
nice work reaching up don't bounce off
the ground stay under control you got it
nice work nice work we got 10 more
seconds on this one feeling those ABS
start to work that's a good thing that's
the feeling of improvement right there
and three two one and zero okay we're
going to rest that's the end of the
first round we got one more to go
all right so it's a quick 20 second
break that doesn't give you much time if
you want feel free to grab some water
shake it loose take a couple deep
breaths we're going to get right back
into it all right so we got ten seconds
I'm going to grab my dumbbells we're
getting ready we're starting with the
row we're gonna I'm doing my crusher row
Claudia's doing her T row and here we go
we're pulling back at those elbows
keeping our core nice and tight and if
you're wondering why we didn't take a
longer break even though we're beginners
that's because the workout specifically
designed to allow some muscles to rest
while others are working so right now
our backs working but at the same time
our chest may be resting allows us to
get a lot done in a short period of time
again pulling back on those elbows
anytime you're doing a row you want to
be like you have a string attached to
your elbows and you're just pulling back
on it just be sure to keep that core
tight also exactly you don't want your
back getting loose or allowing your abs
to relax
almost there on this one let's go five
four three two
and one all right going to the ground
you need both weights for this next one
doing that hip up plus chest press so
we're driving off the heels and
squeezing our glutes and pressing up at
the same time nice work and again on any
of these don't feel like you have to use
the same weight for all of them feel
free to adjust the weight as you go through
it start with your best guesss but don't
just keep the weight if 
you're not able to complete the reps in
a safe manner or the other way if it's
not challenging you make sure to up the
weight so you can get that full benefit
nice work driving off the heels pressing
straight up keep it up guys almost there
and five four three two one zero
we're up on our feet and try to keep the
pace up a little bit faster for the
second round because we know what we're
doing we're going to stiff leg deadlift
or RDL plus shrug kick back
right below your knees pop em and shrug taking
the weight back on our hips feeling that
stretch and up and shrug nice work this
one really hits that whole posterior
chain so important I always say in your
front are the show muscles in the back
are the go muscles basically means all
your power and real athleticism comes
from your backside come on keep it up
you got it nice work not many left let's
go five more seconds that's it and four
three two one and zero finishing strong
okay grab your seat if you got one so if
you're doing your shoulder press 
seated feel free to grab it otherwise
kicking them up getting right into it
bring those dumbbells down to about in
line with your ears maybe just a little
bit lower really depends on your
flexibility and what feels comfortable
don't take it to a place it feels
awkward with your
shoulders nice work core stays tight
doesn't matter either one whichever one
you're doing still stays tight
nice work this is about that point in
the workout where you start to really
feel it it starts to kick in and it
becomes all mental right now not even
physical it's all up in your head it's
all that mental toughness and grip
that's going to keep you moving and
fighting through rep by Rep let's go
come on and five four three two one zero
ahh all right feeling good moving on to
a dumbbell curl so we're hitting the
biceps next let's get it both curling at
the same time
curling those pinkies in there we go
arms are starting to be a little bit get
a little bit lactic acid built up in
them remember you don't have to listen
to that that's just a pain signal but
the muscles got plenty left you got this
come on
driving through curl those pinkies in
shoulders are back nice work one right
into the next using good form not swinging the
weights not getting a bunch of momentum
involved almost there let's go five more
seconds that's it and four three two one
zero
all right all right we're moving on to
either a dumbbell squat or a dumbbell
goblet squat from the chair I'll clean
that name up later okay so we're doing
going into our squats weights back in
our hips making sure to break at the
hips every time because if you don't
what happens is you bend at the knees
first and you end up here and then
you're like oh man my knees hurt hips
back then squat that's the key keep
those feet flat drive off the heels nice
work you got it every squat you do
you're going to get that much better at
it nobody starts great at these I
promise you it's work putting in the
work right here and you will see the
results I promise you come back repeat
