we're kind of doing it now but I'm going
to officially start it in a second and
the first exercise is going to be a
hooking knee with the left hand okay so
we're going to start with the March
we're gonna pick it up three two one
core tight 20 seconds and we're gonna
move straight into that hooking knee
breathe breathe breathe I'm gonna count
us down into it enjoying that march and
coming forward in three
two one with me hooking knee there we go
so keeping nice and strong you can have
weights with you like Angie I'll be
honest I don't envy her one little bit
it's tough enough you can go slow you
can go fast it's your pace let's dig let's
work be strong nice deep breaths engage work
through you've got that water you've got
that towel at any time you can go to it
and three in two and in one that was 40
seconds of work breathe breathe get that
energy back in focus good crisp
movements good form it's not about
keeping up it's about doing it right
we're gonna go over to the other side in
three two one here we go so the opposite
side now really important we got that core
engaged
all our impact
everything we do here we will start is
one low-impact and two standing so you
could be confident that you can be
involved and work out the whole way
through that's different than saying you
have to do every single moment but you
can be doing it with us feeling this now
already three two one I'm loving this
feel the energy from these guys deep
breaths hydrate water if you need it
looking good their way the next exercise
is gonna be a shoulder raise lunge shoulder
raise lunge I finally got that which is
going to be here three two one here we
go so the pace is high you cango slow or you
can go fast it is called real Star Plus
in case you're already a little bit
upset with us for the speed and the
intensity but this is about taking your
body on that bit further feel good
wherever you are if you need to break
halfway through it's about progress not
perfection do your best
march whenever you have to be strong
three two and one and a nice march next
one is a touch and knee raise okay and
we're gonna touch and raise into the
right knee
so fast pace keep marching if you have
to three two one here we go so we touch
one knee forty seconds here you're gonna
find that that build up is intense
through the planted leg not the one that
you're raising right come on guys let's
work this it's about desire the physical
body can do so much it's in the mind
about determination that's what gets you
through the moments I know you can I
know you will in three two and one
and breathe get that water use that
towel if you need to
good work Wade loving that extra effort
I can feel it Angie and them weights all
right I so don't envy you we got
straight punches three two one
I practiced this workout the other day
I've got about 20 seconds in with
weights and I thought I'll give them to
Angie I don't think I can do that not ready for that
it's tough enough as it is keep that core
strong get them punches out
powerfully your best punches punch
someone as always at body project
you can punch anyone you like
except Angie me or Wade that's off-limits
as much as you might want to three two

march it out deep breaths deep breaths
feeling good we've got this we've got
this it's the touch and knee raise
coming to the left keep marching three
two one so we come we lift the left knee
now keep that core strong you can slow
right down if you just want to put some
squats in for a second as well that's
fine you can kind of stand to like this
I might have lost everybody there but it's
important to show you some different
variations working through remember this
workout is designed to be tough please
press pause whenever you have to take an
extra break whenever you need to and
march and breathe fortunately we've got
a little bit of time off cardio now

we've got some more tough work on the
legs with some sidestep resistance in
three two and one let's step it out now

are you going Angie good Angie I've been
wanting to do that for years ANGIE right
I don't think Angie likes me as much as she
did before other side three two one here
we go so I like a little arm movement

first-ever buddies project work out how
well did these guys do it is like we've
all been in the shower right yeah let's
get stretched off what a fantastic
effort keep marching keep moving little
side steps now that is what I call a
kick off workout I just figured if
you're gonna be here of filming we might
as well go in at the deep end right we
might as well just go in and get it done
how good
does it feel now how good do you feel
having done that session today little
open up at the arms we're gonna start
our stretch we'll just let that heart
rate come down it takes a little while
and stretch out right leg first with the
quad core tight nice deep breaths and
then change over to the other side
breathe in deep I am honestly still
struggling to get my breath back that's
how it's feeling like a nice stretch
through the quads low-impact I'll say
again all standing that was a body
changing change juice filled workout
core strong and as long as you're here
stretching with us whether you press
pause 20 times whether you did half of
each section or 10 percent of each
section it doesn't matter because you
can come back tomorrow and do a little
bit more if you marched through the
whole session that's great
never question yourself every moment
that you move your body is a step
towards the outcome that you want
it's not gonna be dramatic change comes
because of consistent decisions and the
day is a workout but done
however you did with it it is done it is
the win and nobody can take that away
from you now it's a win we've won it's
over unless you're doing another workout
and in that case I probably question
your sanity but that's up to you
lifting up above I am certainly done for
the day
that's 100% and let's enjoy a nice hang here
over as we say luxuriating enjoying and
relishing of victory and our own
brilliance what a great session
excellent job excellent job
how you feeling Wade you're feeling good
how'd it go for you Angie
