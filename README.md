Analyze text from aerobics workouts to determine whether the phrases are helpful or confusing

Getting started:

With the following notes, I am referring to directions on https://www.nltk.org/install.html, but read my notes below before beginning.
1. Make sure you have python installed on your computer: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. I recommend installing anaconda to maintain python environments, like it is suggested on the webpage.
3. Contrary to what it says, you can run the "Mac/Unix" instructions on a Windows machine. To do so, run "Anaconda prompt" (after installing anaconda mentioned above). You will get a terminal window. Complete the "Mac/Unix" instructions in that terminal. #2 I would install numpy.
4. After completing step #3 in the "Mac/Unix" instructions, scroll down to "Installing NLTK Data."

Then, you can follow this tutorial to install nltk packages and run basic text analysis. This should give us the foundation to get started: https://likegeeks.com/nlp-tutorial-using-python-nltk/

It is fine if you explore these things and keep the code out of this repository. But when we start writing code for the project, make sure you are in your anaconda environment with everything installed. I added a file I was using along with the tutorial to .gitignore so that I could keep it around, but not have it pushed.
